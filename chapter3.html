    <h1>CHAPTER 3</h1>
    <p class="chapter-title">What the Heart Hides</p>

    <div class="scene-break">✧ ✧ ✧</div>

    <p>The world that materialized around us was wrong in ways that defied description.</p>

    <p>I stood in Oakwood Village, but not the village I knew. This Oakwood burned. Flames consumed everything, shadow beasts tearing through streets that ran with blood. Screams echoed from every direction, familiar voices crying out for help that would never come.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"No." The word ripped from my throat. "NO!"</p>

    <p>I tried to run, to help, to do <em>something</em>, but my legs were lead, my body refusing every command.</p>

    <p>From the flames, a figure emerged. My father. Master Smith Garrick, the man who raised me, taught me everything I knew.</p>

    <p>But his face... gods, his face was twisted with such profound disappointment that it hurt worse than any blade.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You left us." His voice was ash and accusation. "Ran off chasing glory with your magic sword while we burned. While everyone you ever knew died screaming."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I didn't, I'm trying to save, "</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Save?" Another voice. My mother materialized beside him, her kind eyes now hollow with betrayal. "You're not saving anyone. You're a selfish boy playing hero because you can't stand being ordinary."</p>

    <p>The words landed like physical blows. Because wasn't there truth in them? Hadn't some part of me thrilled at being chosen, at finally being <em>special</em>?</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Is that what you think of me?" I whispered.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"It's what you think of yourself," my father said. "Deep down, you know you're not the hero. You're just a blacksmith's son who got lucky. And your luck is about to run out."</p>

    <p>Around them, more figures appeared. Villagers I'd known all my life, all burning, all staring with those accusatory eyes.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"This isn't real," I said, but my voice shook. Stellaria felt cold and distant in my hand, its light dimmed to barely a flicker.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Isn't it?" My mother reached for me with burning hands. "Or is this the future you're creating? Every moment you waste playing hero, Malachar grows stronger. More villages will burn. More families will die. Because of you."</p>

    <p>I fell to my knees, the weight of it crushing me.</p>

    <p>Then I heard it, a sound that cut through everything else.</p>

    <p>Crying.</p>

    <p>I turned. Lyra stood twenty feet away, but she wasn't the cold, composed priestess I'd met in the forest. This Lyra was younger, couldn't be more than eight years old, dressed in a simple village dress instead of pristine robes.</p>

    <p>And she was surrounded by figures in white temple robes, all towering over her, all speaking in voices that dripped with cold disdain.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Weak," one said.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Emotional," another added.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Unworthy of the temple."</p>

    <p>Child-Lyra sobbed, trying to hold it in, failing. "I'm sorry, I'm trying, "</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"A priestess must be pure," the central figure said, an older woman with a face like carved marble. "Above human weakness. You feel too much. Care too much. You watched your village burn and you <em>cried</em>. That failure will define you."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"But they were my family," child-Lyra whispered.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"The temple is your family now. If you cannot let go of sentiment, you will never be worthy."</p>

    <p>The scene shifted. Lyra was older now, maybe sixteen, kneeling before the same marble-faced woman.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Please," teenage Lyra begged, "let me fight. Let me help stop the shadow beasts. I can use magic, I can, "</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You can follow orders," the woman cut her off. "The temple's role is to pray, to maintain the sacred rites. Not to dirty ourselves with combat. Accept your place, Lyra."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"But people are dying!"</p>

    <p>A slap. Sharp. Brutal.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You <em>dare</em> question the temple's wisdom? This is exactly why you will never rise above initiate. You lack discipline. Control." The woman's voice was ice. "You are a disappointment."</p>

    <p>The vision shifted again and again, a thousand small cruelties, a lifetime of being told she wasn't enough, that caring was weakness, that her desire to help made her a failure.</p>

    <p>And through it all, Lyra stood frozen, tears streaming down her face, the real Lyra, the one from my time, watching her own past play out like a nightmare she couldn't escape.</p>

    <p>Something in me broke.</p>

    <p>Not shattered, transformed. The crushing weight of my own fears suddenly felt small compared to what I was witnessing. This woman who'd been nothing but cold and contemptuous, who'd mocked me and dismissed me...</p>

    <p>She'd been carved into that shape by years of cruelty.</p>

    <p>I stood up.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You're wrong," I said to the illusions of my parents. My voice was steady now, certain. "Maybe I am just a blacksmith's son. Maybe I am ordinary. But that doesn't make me useless."</p>

    <p>I walked toward them, and they flickered like dying flames.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I didn't choose this sword to be special. It chose me. And maybe, " I gripped Stellaria tighter, feeling its warmth return, ", maybe the point isn't that I'm the best warrior or the smartest tactician. Maybe the point is that I'm willing to try when others won't."</p>

    <p>The illusions of my parents dissolved into light.</p>

    <p>I turned to Lyra, still frozen in her memories. Her tormentors still circling, still cutting her down with words designed to wound.</p>

    <p>I walked through them like they were smoke.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Lyra."</p>

    <p>She looked up, tears streaking down her face, and for the first time since I'd met her, she looked utterly vulnerable.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Don't look at me," she choked out. "Don't see me like this."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Too late." I knelt in front of her, meeting her eyes. "I see you, Lyra. All of you."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"They told me feeling was weakness," she whispered.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"They lied." Anger heated my voice. "Feeling, caring, that's not weakness. It's the only thing that matters."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"They said I was a disappointment, "</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"They were wrong." I took her hands in mine. "You volunteered for this mission knowing you might die. You came into this trial with me when you could have walked away. You're here, right now, facing your worst memories instead of running."</p>

    <p>I squeezed her hand.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"That's not weakness, Lyra. That's courage. The kind that matters most."</p>

    <p>Her eyes widened, searching mine for the lie, the trick, the cruelty she'd learned to expect.</p>

    <p>She found none.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I..." Her voice cracked. "I'm terrified. All the time. That I'm not good enough, that I'll fail, that everyone I try to save will die anyway and it will be my fault."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Me too," I admitted. "I'm scared I'm not the hero they need. That I'll let everyone down."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Then why do you keep going?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Because," I said, helping her to her feet, "being afraid and doing it anyway, that's what being brave actually is."</p>

    <p>The illusions around us began to crack, golden light bleeding through.</p>

    <p>Stellaria blazed suddenly, green-gold radiance exploding outward. Lyra's magic flared in response, silver intertwining with gold.</p>

    <p>When we'd admitted our fears, accepted them instead of fighting them, the trial's power shattered like glass.</p>

    <div class="scene-break">✧ ✧ ✧</div>

    <p>We stood in a garden that belonged in dreams. Flowers in every impossible color bloomed under a sky of gentle stars. Theron stood at the center, and his ancient face was soft with something almost like pride.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You passed the Path of Heart," he said quietly. "Not by defeating your fears, but by accepting them. By seeing each other's pain and choosing compassion over judgment."</p>

    <p>He approached me, placing one massive wooden hand on Stellaria's blade. The sword erupted with green light, vines of living energy wrapping around the metal before being absorbed into it.</p>

    <p>I felt the change immediately, a connection to everything growing, every living thing for miles around. Nature itself seemed to pulse in time with my heartbeat.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"The power of life," Theron said. "You can heal wounds, sense the living, draw strength from the earth, and call upon nature to aid you in battle." He paused. "But more than that, you've learned something more valuable, that strength and vulnerability are not opposites. They are partners."</p>

    <p>He looked between us. "You two are stronger together than apart. The trial showed you each other's deepest wounds. And you chose empathy."</p>

    <p>Lyra was staring at me with an expression I couldn't quite read. Shock? Confusion? Something else?</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I..." She started, then stopped. Swallowed hard. "Thank you. For what you said. In there."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I meant it."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I know. That's what makes it..." She looked away, color rising in her cheeks. "I was cruel to you. From the moment we met. I judged you, belittled you, assumed you would fail."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You were protecting yourself," I said. "I understand that now."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"It wasn't fair to you." She met my eyes again, and this time there was something raw there, something real. "I'm sorry."</p>

    <p>The words hung between us like a bridge being built.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Two more Guardians remain," Theron interrupted gently. "But darkness moves against you. Malachar's generals have been dispatched. You must choose your next move carefully."</p>

    <p>A vision formed, three shimmering images in the air.</p>

    <p><strong>The Capital City</strong> - Under siege by shadow beasts. People dying in the streets. Desperate.</p>

    <p><strong>The Frost Mountains</strong> - The Ice Guardian's temple. More power, but time lost.</p>

    <p><strong>The Desert of Mirrors</strong> - The Fire Guardian, but Malachar's strongest general patrols those wastes.</p>

    <p>Lyra looked at me, and for the first time, it wasn't with contempt. "Your choice, Chosen Warrior. Not because I'm mocking you. Because... the sword chose you. And maybe, after seeing what I saw in there..." She took a breath. "Maybe it chose better than I thought."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"The Frost Mountains," I decided. "I want to help the capital, but rushing in half-ready won't save anyone. We need to be stronger."</p>

    <p>Lyra nodded slowly. "Wise. Glacius, the Ice Guardian, is the oldest and most powerful of the three. Also the most dangerous. His trials have killed more chosen ones than succeeded."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Comforting."</p>

    <p>A ghost of a smile touched her lips. "I'm not known for my bedside manner."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I noticed."</p>

    <p>Theron raised his hand. The forest parted, revealing a northern path. "You'll need speed." He whistled, a sound like wind through autumn leaves.</p>

    <p>Two magnificent creatures descended from the canopy. They looked like deer, but larger, ethereal, antlers glowing with soft moonlight, coats shimmering between silver and green.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Moonstriders," Lyra breathed, and for the first time I heard genuine awe in her voice. "They're supposed to be extinct."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Not extinct. Merely hidden." Theron gestured to them. "They will carry you to the mountains swiftly. But heed my warning, Glacius does not trust easily. His trials will test you in ways my forest cannot."</p>

    <p>I approached one of the Moonstriders. It lowered its head, allowing me to mount. The sensation was otherworldly, like sitting on condensed starlight.</p>

    <p>Lyra mounted the other with practiced grace.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Thank you, Guardian Theron," I said.</p>

    <p>He nodded. "May the living earth guide your steps. And priestess, " he looked at Lyra, ", never let them convince you your heart is weakness. It is your greatest weapon."</p>

    <p>Tears shone in Lyra's eyes. "Thank you," she whispered.</p>
