## PROLOGUE: BEFORE THE VOWS

### **DANTE'S PERSPECTIVE**

I don’t believe in fate.

Fate is the word weak men reach for when the weight of their own decisions starts to crush them. A soft excuse. A comforting lie. Something to blame when the bill finally comes due. I don’t believe in destiny or cosmic plans or invisible hands guiding anything. I believe in blood. I believe in leverage. I believe in the precise gravity of a name spoken in the right room at the right moment, and in the way that room goes silent afterward.

My name is Dante Morelli.

If you’ve heard it before, then you already understand why people hesitate when they say it. You already know enough to be afraid.

I was born into violence the way other children are born into comfort. It wasn’t a deviation. It was the default. Violence was my inheritance, my education, my first language. The Morelli family has ruled New York’s underworld for three generations, and I am what comes next. Not the eldest son. That was Antonio, until two bullets ended his claim on a sidewalk outside a Queens restaurant. Not the sharpest mind. That’s Lucia, who turns blood money into clean ledgers and balanced books.

But I am the most dangerous.

I am the one they send when conversation collapses. When deals rot. When mercy is no longer part of the equation. When the message has to be delivered in a way that can’t be misunderstood.

I am beautiful.

I say it the way one acknowledges an undeniable truth, stripped of vanity or hesitation. The way you register the sharpness of a blade before it cuts, or the color of the sky just before a storm breaks. My eyes are blue, pale and cold, the kind that never look away first. My hair is red, catching the light like a warning flare, impossible to unsee once it’s burned into your vision. A face that makes women misplace their caution and men quietly question their own worth.

I have never pursued attention.

It follows me instead, instinctively. The way blood unfurls through water. Slow. Inevitable. Hungry.

And yes, I use it.

Beauty is just another weapon. It opens doors that should stay closed. It lowers defenses people swear they’ll keep up. It convinces them the damage I’m capable of must be exaggerated, theatrical, someone else’s reputation mistaken for mine. By the time they realize otherwise, running is no longer an option. I’ve cut throats while women whispered my name like a secret. I’ve burned enemies alive while their friends stared at my face instead of reaching for their guns. Prettiness. Cruelty. Control. I learned early how to sharpen all three until they were indistinguishable.

My father is dying.

Lung cancer.

Six months, maybe less, according to men who lower their voices and refuse to meet my eyes, as if death might jump from him to them if they’re careless enough. His body is rotting from the inside out, drowning slowly in its own decay, and he knows it. He feels the clock in his chest every time he coughs. Every time blood rises where air should be.

So he has spent the last year doing what dying kings always do.

Strangling uncertainty.

Every loose end has been pulled tight enough to cut. Every potential rival weighed, neutralized, or marked for elimination. Power has been stacked where no one can reach it, layered with threats and favors and blood debts, all designed to survive him. He is building a future that won’t hesitate to devour itself the moment he’s lowered into the ground.

Because succession is never peaceful.

It is a carcass thrown into a pit, and whoever claws their way out alive gets to rule what’s left.

Part of his solution is ending a war that has been feeding on us for nearly a decade. A slow hemorrhage of bodies and money and influence. A conflict that has already taken more than it ever gave back.

He doesn’t want peace.

He wants control that will outlive his corpse.

The Bratva.
The Russian mob.
And, more precisely, the Rostov family.

Viktor Rostov is vicious in the ancient sense of the word. Not impulsive. Not theatrical. The kind of man who learned early that power is built by standing on bodies and never acknowledging the sound they make when they stop breathing. He didn’t climb so much as carve his way upward, leaving a trail of broken men and unfinished graves behind him. Fear is his native language. Death, his punctuation. Anyone who ever stood in his path learned the same lesson: they were temporary. Expendable. Already dead, whether they knew it yet or not.

For years, our families have existed in a state of mutual slaughter. Not chaos. Not rage. Precision. Soldier for soldier. Name for name. A clean, methodical exchange of corpses. An economy of violence that feeds no one and poisons everything it touches. Each retaliation demands another. Each victory rots into weakness. We’ve been bleeding slowly, deliberately, like animals too proud to step away from the trap.

My father, pragmatic down to the bone, finally decided the math no longer worked.

He didn’t mourn the dead. He didn’t rage at the injustice of it all. He simply recognized that the cycle would eventually consume us both, leaving nothing worth inheriting.

So he chose a cleaner solution.

A treaty.

Not written in ink. Written in flesh.

Sealed with a marriage.

His son. Rostov’s daughter.

Me. And her.

I heard her name once.

Vivienne Rostova. Twenty-six. Trained. Dangerous in the way Bratva daughters are taught to be dangerous. Not wild, not reckless, but engineered. Educated in violence the way other women are educated in etiquette. Raised to be useful. Raised to be leverage. Raised with the unspoken understanding that if her value ever diminished, she would be discarded without ceremony.

I was handed a photograph.

Dark hair. Pale skin. High cheekbones. A face composed with deliberate symmetry. Beautiful, in the clinical sense. The kind of beauty that photographs well and bleeds just as easily as anything else.

Beauty means very little in my world.

It’s the most abundant currency there is.

I didn’t ask questions.

I didn’t argue.

This was never meant to be a romance.

It was business. A merger. A calculated binding of two families that would otherwise continue bleeding each other into extinction. A solution born of arithmetic, not sentiment. She would be my wife on paper only, a carefully placed symbol of peace meant to quiet guns and postpone graves.

I would give her a title. A house. A bed she would learn to leave untouched and cold.

In return, I expected silence.

Obedience.

Nothing more.

I expected weakness.

A woman shaped by violence and emptied by it. Someone who learned to survive by complying, by making herself smaller, by folding quietly beneath the will of men who decided her fate without ever asking. Someone who would meet my gaze with fear. Or bitterness. Or that slow, bloodless resignation that kills a person long before the body follows. Someone who would fade into irrelevance the moment the ink dried on the contract.

I expected someone forgettable.

I am, as it turns out, completely wrong.

I just don’t know it yet.

Three hours before my wedding, I’m standing in a warehouse in Brooklyn, executing a man who forgot where his loyalty was supposed to live.

His name is irrelevant. Names lose their value the moment betrayal enters the equation. What matters is the mistake. The choice. The arrogance of thinking consequences can be outsourced.

He sold information to the Calabrese family, convinced himself they could bury him deep enough that my reach would stop at the state line. It didn’t. We tore him out of a safe house in Jersey, bound him while he screamed, let him bleed just enough to stay conscious, and brought him back to the city. Back to where he belonged.

Now he’s on his knees on cold concrete, soaked in his own blood. His hands won’t stop shaking. His eyes are wide with the late, useless understanding that every bad decision is patient, and that it always comes to collect.

“**Please,**” he chokes, voice collapsing in on itself. “**Please, Dante. I have a family. I have—**”

I don’t let him finish.

The bullet enters cleanly between his eyes. No hesitation. No ceremony. The sound snaps through the empty warehouse and hangs there, sharp and final, like the last word in a conversation that ended long before he realized it. His body folds forward, lifeless, as if someone simply turned him off.

One of my men steps forward and drags the corpse away, leaving a dark smear across the floor where he stopped being a problem.

I glance at my watch.

Two hours and forty minutes until the wedding.

I’m still wearing the suit I’ll stand at the altar in. Custom-tailored. Charcoal gray. Italian silk. It was immaculate once. Now it’s flecked with blood, some of it still wet, catching the light when I move, darkening the fabric like a quiet confession. Evidence that hasn’t had time to dry.

I consider changing.

The thought doesn’t survive long enough to matter.

No.

Let her see it. Let her take it in without explanation or apology. Let her understand, immediately and without room for misunderstanding, exactly what she’s agreeing to. Who she’s binding herself to. What kind of man arrives at his own wedding carrying death with him like an accessory.

I want no illusions between us. No softened edges. No polite lies.

I don’t believe in pretense.

If this marriage is going to be a lie, then it will be an honest one—stripped of illusion, soaked in truth, and paid for in blood. No masks. No gentle fiction. Just exactly what we are, standing in full view, daring the world to look away.

### **VIVIENNE'S PERSPECTIVE**

I’ve been dead inside since I was twelve years old.

Not metaphorically. Not poetically. Dead in the clinical sense. Neurologically. The parts of me where empathy, fear, and guilt are supposed to live simply… don’t. I know this because I’ve been tested. Evaluated. Observed under cold lights by men in white coats who asked their careful questions while my brain flickered across monitors. They watched. They measured. And they concluded, with varying degrees of professional distance, that I am a psychopath.

They’re right.

I don’t feel the way other people do. I don’t bond. I don’t attach. I don’t lie awake drowning in regret or shame or yearning for things I’ve lost. I experience the world as a sequence of transactions. Strategic exchanges. Variables to be solved or removed. When emotions surface, they are thin and temporary. Curiosity. Irritation. Boredom. Nothing with roots. Nothing that stays.

My father made me this way.

Viktor Rostov has never been a sentimental man. When I was born, he saw an asset, not a daughter. When my mother died of cancer—when I was six—he saw opportunity. No softness left to interfere. No one to object. He shaped me the way a man shapes a weapon meant to last. Languages. Combat. Seduction. Marksmanship. Poisons. Interrogation. Control. Precision. Obedience to outcome, not morality.

By the time I was twelve, I killed my first target.

A low-level rival skimming money from one of my father’s operations. Insignificant in the larger scheme. Disposable. Necessary.

I remember placing the gun against his head.

I remember pulling the trigger.

I remember feeling nothing.

And I remember my father’s approval, sharp and unmistakable.

**“Good,”** he said. **“No hesitation. That’s my girl.”**

Since then, I’ve killed one hundred and forty-seven people.

I stopped counting after that. Not because of guilt. Guilt never entered the equation. The number simply stopped being interesting. Some deaths were quick. Bullets. Clean. Efficient. Others were slower. Blades. Garrotes. Pain measured carefully when information had to come first. I was good at it. Exceptional. The best, my father would say, though praise from him was rare and always earned in blood.

In certain circles, I became known as Viper.

I didn’t choose the name. I didn’t reject it either. It fit too well.

And then, gradually, inevitably, boredom set in.

Killing lost its edge.

What was once electric and intimate became routine. Procedural. Mechanical. Pull the trigger. Wipe the blade. Move on. There was no challenge left. No risk. No one who could match me, surprise me, or push hard enough to make something stir inside my chest. Nothing that felt even remotely like excitement.

Just emptiness.

And time stretching endlessly in front of me, waiting for something—anything—to finally break the monotony.

I am twenty-six years old, and I am exhausted by my own existence.

Not tired in the way people mean when they complain about long days or sleepless nights. This is deeper than fatigue. It’s the weariness of repetition. Of knowing exactly how every situation will end before it begins. Of moving through life untouched by it, unstimulated, unchanged.

Then my father tells me I’m getting married.

He doesn’t ask. He informs.

An arranged marriage, designed to cauterize a war that’s been bleeding both families dry for years. Dante Morelli. Heir to the Italian mob. A man I’ve never met, but whose reputation travels faster than his shadow. Brutal. Sadistic. Unstable when it serves him, precise when it doesn’t. A killer, like me. A psychopath, most likely, though I doubt anyone ever bothered to diagnose him.

They give me a dossier.

Photographs. Intelligence reports. Behavioral profiles.

He’s beautiful.

Pale blue eyes. Red hair. A face that could belong in a museum or a nightmare, depending on where you’re standing. But beauty doesn’t impress me. Beauty is tactical. It’s leverage. It’s camouflage. It’s a tool, and I understand its mechanics better than most. What holds my attention is the violence threaded through his record. The bodies left behind. The efficiency. The whispers about his appetite for cruelty when restraint no longer serves a purpose.

Most women, I imagine, would be terrified.

I’m intrigued.

Not because I expect kindness. Not because I’m foolish enough to romanticize what this is. This isn’t love, and it isn’t partnership. It’s curiosity. Sharp and unfamiliar. The kind I haven’t felt in years. I wonder if he’s truly as dangerous as they claim. I wonder if he’ll bore me the way everyone else eventually does. I wonder if he’ll fracture when I test him—and I will test him—or if he’ll push back hard enough to make things interesting.

I agree without protest.

My father is visibly surprised. He’d anticipated resistance. Negotiation. Perhaps even defiance. Instead, I nod once and ask when the wedding is.

“**Two weeks,**” he says.

**“Fine.”**

He watches me for a long moment, searching for something he’s never managed to find. Fear. Resentment. Doubt. Anything recognizably human. He comes up empty, as always.

“**You understand what this means,**” he says carefully. “**You’ll belong to him. To the Morelli family. You’ll be expected to—**”

**“I understand,”** I cut in. **“I’ll play the role.”**

I always do.

And then the day of the wedding arrives.

I’m dressed in white.

The gown is custom-made, elegant, traditional down to every deliberate stitch. It fits perfectly, which only makes it feel more like a costume. That’s appropriate. This is theater. A performance staged for power and appearances. I’ll stand at an altar, recite vows that mean nothing, and legally bind myself to a man I’ve never met.

And then I’ll see what he’s made of.

The ceremony takes place in a cathedral in Manhattan. Neutral ground. Sacred stone temporarily borrowed by men who kill for a living. Both families are present, along with their respective entourages, an uneasy peace maintained by mutual self-interest and loaded guns beneath tailored jackets. I take my place at the altar and wait.

He’s late.

Ten minutes.
Fifteen.
Twenty.

A low murmur spreads through the pews like a nervous infection. My father’s jaw tightens, the muscle ticking beneath his skin. The priest shifts his weight, sweat gathering at his collar. I remain perfectly still, unbothered. Lateness is information. Either a delay beyond his control or a deliberate assertion of power. Both are instructive.

Then the doors open.

Dante Morelli steps inside.

He’s wearing a charcoal-gray suit, immaculately tailored, the kind of craftsmanship that announces money before he ever speaks.

It’s covered in blood.

Fresh. Still darkening the fabric in places. Flecked across his chest and sleeves. A careless smear along his jaw, as if violence followed him here and he couldn’t be bothered to wash it off. He walks down the aisle without haste, without apology, pale blue eyes sweeping the cathedral with the calm confidence of a man who already owns the room.

Everything stops.

My father’s men tense, hands drifting just a little closer to concealed weapons. The Morelli soldiers remain motionless, unreadable. The priest looks like he might be sick.

And I smile.

Not politely.
Not nervously.

A real smile.

Because for the first time in a very, very long time, something sharp and electric sparks to life inside me.

Interest.

He reaches the altar and stops in front of me. Our eyes lock, and for a suspended moment, neither of us speaks. He studies me the way I study him. Measuring. Weighing. Calculating risk and reward.

“**You’re late,**” I say, my voice calm.

**“Needed to take care of something.”** he replies.

**“I can see that.”**

The corner of his mouth lifts, not quite a smile. “**Does it bother you?**”

**“No.”**

**“Good.”**

The priest clears his throat, eager to move forward before this becomes something else entirely.

**“Shall we begin?”** he asks, his voice thin.

Dante doesn’t look away from me.

**“Let’s.”**

---

### **THE UNSPOKEN TRUTH**

What neither of us says, standing at the altar beneath vaulted stone and watching eyes, beneath God and the brittle treaty stitching our families together, is this:

We recognize each other.

Not romantically. Not in the childish sense of fate or soulmates or stars aligning just so. There is nothing poetic about it.

It’s instinct.

The way predators identify their own across a distance. The way something old and precise wakes up and pays attention.

He sees the emptiness in me immediately. The absence behind the smile. The cold arithmetic running beneath my calm. He understands, without needing it explained, that what looks like composure is simply lack of fear.

I see the chaos in him. The violence coiled so tightly it looks like control. He wears it naturally, like a second skin, like something that has never known how to be removed.

Most people would recoil from this realization.

Most people would feel the warning and step back.

We lean in.

This marriage was meant to be a strategy. A merger. A calculated move to stop the bleeding before it destroyed us all.

It isn’t going to be that.

It’s going to be far worse.

And far, far better.

---

## THE WORLD

**Setting:** New York City, present day  
**Power Structure:**
- **Morelli Family (Italian Mob):** Controls trafficking, loan sharking, protection rackets, legitimate businesses (restaurants, construction)
- **Rostov Bratva (Russian Mob):** Controls arms dealing, human trafficking, cybercrime, money laundering

**The War:** The two families have been killing each other for a decade over territorial disputes. Both are weakened. Both are bleeding resources. The marriage is a truce, but truces in this world are fragile things, held together by self-interest and the threat of mutually assured destruction.

**The Stakes:** If the marriage fails, the war resumes. If either family shows weakness, rival factions (Calabrese, Yakuza, Triads) will move in. Both Dante and Vivienne understand this. Neither particularly cares. They're more interested in each other.

---

## THEMES

- **Violence as intimacy:** For Dante and Vivienne, violence isn't just a tool—it's a language, a form of connection
- **Toxicity as compatibility:** They're not good for each other. They're perfect for each other. There's a difference.
- **Power dynamics:** Constant struggle for control, neither willing to submit, both thriving in the push-and-pull
- **The void:** What happens when two people incapable of love find the only person who understands that emptiness?

---

## TONE & STYLE

**Narrative Voice:** Second person (You are Dante) for immersion and complicity  
**Prose Style:** Sharp, visceral, unflinching. No romanticizing the violence. No apologizing for the characters.  
**Pacing:** Slow burn tension punctuated by explosive moments (literal and metaphorical)  
**Content Warnings:** Extreme violence, murder, morally bankrupt protagonists, toxic relationship dynamics, sexual content, psychological manipulation

---

## NOW WE BEGIN

The priest finishes the vows.

There’s a pause. The kind heavy with expectation. Tradition dictates the next move.

You’re supposed to kiss your bride.

Vivienne looks up at you, waiting. There’s no tremor in her gaze. No nerves. No soft anticipation. Just cool, clinical curiosity, sharp enough to cut. She’s watching you the way she’d watch a weapon being drawn. Interested in how you’ll use it.

You step closer.

The blood on your suit smears against the white of her gown, a dark, intimate stain blooming where it shouldn’t. A desecration, some would call it.

She doesn’t flinch.

You lift a hand and cup her face. Your knuckles are still bruised, skin split and tender from earlier. From breaking a man open piece by piece until the truth spilled out, and then ending him. The marks are fresh. Honest.

Her skin beneath your palm is cold.

You kiss her.

It isn’t gentle.
It isn’t reverent.
It isn’t romantic.

It’s a claim.

A challenge issued mouth to mouth. Pressure and intent and the unmistakable promise of violence wrapped in intimacy. You take, not ask. You test, not soothe.

When you pull back, she’s smiling.

Not shaken.
Not offended.
Not surprised.

**“Hello, husband,”** she says, voice smooth, almost amused.

**“Hello, wife.”**

The crowd applauds, hesitant at first, then louder. Relief ripples through them. No shots fired. No blood spilled at the altar. A successful ceremony, by their standards.

You don’t let go of her face.

You lean in just enough that only she can hear you.

**“Are you going to be trouble?”** you ask.

Her smile widens, slow and deliberate, eyes gleaming with something dark and delighted.

**“I’m going to be the best trouble you’ve ever had.”**

---

You don't let go of her face.

If anything, your grip tightens. Not enough to hurt her. Never that. Just enough to anchor her there, to make sure she feels you. To make sure she understands this moment is real, that it belongs to both of you. Your thumb drags along the sharp line of her jaw, slow, deliberate, unmistakably possessive.

**"Prove it,"** you murmur, your voice pitched low, meant for her alone.

Her eyes don't widen. They don't soften. They ignite.

Not fear.
Interest.

**"Somewhere private,"** she says smoothly. **"I want to see if you bleed as pretty as you smile."**

She steps closer, presses herself against you harder, deliberately invading your space, daring you to react. She's about to say something else when it happens.

A sound that does not belong in a cathedral.

Glass explodes.

Not cracks. Not trembles. It detonates, stained-glass saints obliterated in an instant, colored shards raining down across marble and silk. Screams tear through the air, sharp and frantic, immediately drowned out by the clean, brutal crack of gunfire echoing through stone and vaulted ceilings.

Someone is shooting up your wedding.

Instinct moves before thought can catch up. You act fast, ruthless, exact. You shove Vivienne down and cover her with your body as bullets rip through what remains of the windows, turning holy icons into glittering wreckage. Chaos erupts. Your men draw weapons. Her father's soldiers return fire. Guests scatter, slipping on polished marble, diving beneath pews like prey animals fleeing a slaughter.

But Vivienne doesn't cower beneath you.

She laughs.

You feel it first, a subtle vibration against your chest. Dark. Delighted. Genuine joy, untouched by the violence tearing the room apart.

**"This is perfect,"** she says, bright and almost giddy, her voice edged with something beautifully unhinged.

A blade flashes.

She produces a knife from somewhere inside her wedding dress. You didn't see it. Didn't sense it. Didn't even consider that she might be armed. She tilts her head up toward you, and for the first time since you met her, her eyes are fully awake. Sharp. Alive. Hungry.

**"So,"** she says lightly, over gunfire and screams, **"do we kill them together, or do we make this a competition?"**

Three realizations hit you all at once.

Your wedding is under attack, likely Calabrese, aiming to erase both heirs in a single, efficient massacre.
Your wife is armed, dangerous, and savoring every second of it.
And somewhere between shattered glass and blood-slick marble, you realize you might actually be in love.

**"Competition,"** you decide.

Your voice is calm. Certain.

**"Whoever kills more buys drinks tonight."**

Her grin turns feral. Beautiful. A promise written in blood.

**"You're on, husband."**

---

## CHAPTER 1: THE BLOOD WEDDING

### DANTE

You roll off her and move.

No hesitation. No wasted motion. Just pure, efficient violence.

Your gun is already in your hand—Beretta M9, custom grip, fifteen rounds—pulled from the shoulder holster beneath your blood-stained jacket. You don't remember drawing it. Muscle memory. Instinct older than thought.

A gunman bursts through the side entrance, tactical gear, ski mask, AR-15 raised. Calabrese colors on his vest. Sloppy. Arrogant. He thinks he's walking into a massacre.

He's right.

Just not his.

You put two rounds center mass before he clears the doorway. He drops, choking on his own blood, weapon clattering across marble. 

**One.**

You don't stop moving.

The cathedral has become a warzone. Your soldiers and the Bratva forces have taken defensive positions, returning fire at the attackers pouring in from multiple entrances. Guests are screaming, crawling, dying. You don't care about them. Collateral damage. Background noise.

What you care about is the body count.

And your wife.

You glance back.

Vivienne is already moving, low and fast, white dress dragging through broken glass and pooling blood. She doesn't run for cover. She runs *toward* the fight.

A gunman rounds the corner near the altar, weapon sweeping for targets.

He never sees her coming.

She closes the distance impossibly fast, a blur of white silk and dark intent. Her knife—thin, professional, probably Russian military issue—flashes once. Twice. Three times. Throat. Kidney. Femoral artery. Precision cuts, each one fatal, executed in less than two seconds.

The man collapses, gurgling, drowning in arterial spray.

She doesn't even look down at him.

**"One,"** she calls out, voice bright, almost singing it.

You can't help it.

You smile.

She nearly trips.

The dress is wrong for this. Too much fabric, too much weight, silk catching where it shouldn't, slowing her by half a second. Half a second is enough in a gunfight.

You see it instantly.

You grab her and pull her in, fast and hard, intending to shield her, to move her out of the line of fire but momentum betrays you. She slams into your chest, closer than planned, closer than smart. Way too close.

Her lips stop inches from yours.

Not a kiss. Not quite. Just breath and heat and chaos.

Both of you are breathing hard. Gunfire cracks behind you. Marble chips explode at your feet. Somewhere, someone screams. But right here, for a suspended, impossible second, the world narrows to the space between your mouths.

You brush her by accident. A bare graze. Enough to be felt. Enough to be noticed.

Her eyes lock onto yours.

No fear. No hesitation.

Recognition.

The kind that hits like impact, sharp and electric, like you've both just realized you're standing in the same storm and neither of you plans to step back.

**"Dress,"** you mutter, low, almost a growl.

Before she can answer, you move.

You take the knife from her hand in one smooth motion, fingers closing around the grip as you pivot behind her, body pressed to her back for a split second longer than necessary. She doesn't resist. Doesn't protest. Trusts you without asking why.

You spin her, fast and controlled, and slash.

Fabric gives way under the blade. Silk tears open with a vicious sound, the skirt of her wedding gown splitting clean, freeing her legs, stripping the dress of its restraint. Another cut. Then another. Practical. Precise. No wasted motion.

She inhales sharply, not from fear.

From thrill.

You step back just enough to finish, eyes never leaving hers as you flick the blade, testing its balance once.

Then you press the knife back into her palm.

Handle first.

Her fingers close around it instantly, like it never left her, like this is exactly where it belongs.

She smiles at you then.

Not sweet. Not soft.

Dangerously intimate.

**"About time,"** she says, rolling her shoulders, newly free, blood and silk brushing the marble. **"Now I can move."**

Gunfire erupts again, closer this time.

You lean in, just enough for her to hear you over the chaos.

**"Try not to slow me down,"** you murmur.

Her eyes burn.

**"Don't worry,"** she replies. **"I'll make it hard for you to keep up."**

Then she turns, dress ruined, knife gleaming, and dives straight back into the violence like it's a dance she was born knowing.

Another attacker appears on your left, firing wild, panicked. Amateur. You sidestep, let the bullets pass where you were standing a heartbeat ago, and return fire. Single shot. Headshot. Brain matter decorates the stained glass behind him.

**Two.**

A third comes from the right. You pivot, fire twice. Chest. Throat. He goes down hard, weapon skittering away.

**Three.**

Movement in your peripheral vision.

Vivienne has engaged two attackers simultaneously. One tries to grab her—stupid, suicidal—and she lets him. Uses his momentum against him, spins inside his guard, and drives her blade up under his ribs, angling toward his heart. Textbook kill. He gasps, eyes wide, and she holds him there for a moment, watching the light fade.

Then she shoves him away and turns on the second attacker.

He raises his gun.

She's faster.

She throws her knife.

It embeds in his eye socket with a wet, meaty sound, punching through to his brain. He drops instantly, dead before he hits the ground.

**"Three,"** she announces, walking calmly to retrieve her blade, pulling it free with a wet *schlik* that echoes despite the gunfire.

You're losing.

Unacceptable.

You spot a cluster of three gunmen advancing down the center aisle, firing in controlled bursts, professional, coordinated. Calabrese elite. Trained. Dangerous.

Not dangerous enough.

You break from cover, sprinting directly at them.

They see you coming. Adjust aim. Fire.

You're already moving, serpentine pattern, making yourself an impossible target. Bullets crack past your head, close enough to feel the displaced air. One grazes your shoulder, tearing fabric, drawing blood.

You don't slow down.

At ten feet, you slide, marble slick with blood, dropping beneath their line of fire. You come up between them, inside their guard, too close for their rifles to track effectively.

Gun to the first one's temple. Fire.

**Four.**

Spin. Elbow strike to the second's throat, crushing his windpipe. He drops, choking, dying slow.

**Five.**

The third tries to swing his rifle like a club. You catch it, redirect the momentum, and use it to pull him off balance. Your gun comes up under his chin. Fire.

**Six.**

The body crumples.

You look up.

Vivienne is standing on top of a pew, elevated, surveying the chaos like a queen surveying her kingdom. Her white dress is soaked red now, impossible to tell how much is hers and how much belongs to others. Probably none of it is hers.

An attacker tries to flank her from behind.

She doesn't turn around.

She just steps backward off the pew, letting gravity do the work, and drops onto him. Her weight drives him down, and her knife is already moving. She stabs him repeatedly—face, neck, chest—each strike precise, clinical, overkill in the most literal sense.

When she stands, she's smiling.

**"Six,"** she says, meeting your eyes across the cathedral.

Tied.

**"Not for long,"** you reply.

The main doors explode inward—not kicked, not shot, literally blown apart with breaching charges. Smoke and splinters fill the air. More gunmen pour through, at least a dozen, heavily armed, organized.

This was planned. Coordinated. A full-scale assassination attempt.

They didn't account for one thing.

Neither of you wants to leave.

You want to *play.*

You reload without looking, muscle memory, mag out, fresh mag in, chamber a round. Fourteen bullets. Fourteen more kills, if you're efficient.

Vivienne has retrieved a second knife from somewhere—maybe off one of the bodies, maybe she had two all along—and she's dual-wielding now, blades reversed, edges out. Combat stance. Feral grace.

She looks at you.

You look at her.

No words needed.

You both move at the same time.

The gunmen spread out, trying to establish crossfire, trying to corner you both. They're thinking tactically, professionally. They're treating this like a military operation.

Mistake.

This isn't war.

This is hunting season.

You take the left flank. Six targets. You move through them like a scalpel through flesh. Shoot, move, shoot, move. No wasted shots. No hesitation. Each kill is efficient, necessary, beautiful in its simplicity.

Headshot. **Seven.**
Double-tap center mass. **Eight.**
Kneecap, then execution shot when he falls. **Nine.**

Behind you, Vivienne is dancing.

There's no other word for it. She flows between attackers like water, blades flashing, always moving, never where they expect. She cuts tendons, severs arteries, destroys joints. Not killing immediately, but ensuring death comes soon, inevitably, painfully.

A man screams as she opens his stomach, his insides spilling onto sacred ground.

**"Seven,"** she counts.

Another drops, throat opened, choking on blood.

**"Eight."**

You catch movement in the choir loft—sniper, trying to get a high angle. Smart. Dangerous.

You fire three shots upward. The first two miss. The third catches him in the shoulder, spinning him around. He falls from the loft, twenty feet down, lands hard. Bones crack audibly.

You walk over. Put a round in his skull.

**Ten.**

A gunman tries to surrender, dropping his weapon, raising his hands.

**"Wait, wait, please—"**

Vivienne doesn't wait.

She's on him before he finishes the sentence, knife buried in his throat. She holds him there, watching his eyes as he dies, studying him like a specimen.

**"Nine,"** she whispers.

You're still ahead.

The remaining attackers are retreating now, realizing this isn't going according to plan, that the targets are hunting *them.* They fall back toward the exits, firing wildly, desperately.

You let them run.

Then you shoot them in the back.

**Eleven. Twelve.**

Vivienne throws one of her knives. It spins end over end, perfect rotation, and embeds between a fleeing attacker's shoulder blades. He stumbles, falls, doesn't get back up.

**"Ten,"** she says.

One gunman left.

He's trapped behind an overturned pew, pinned down by covering fire from your men. Terrified. Alone. Out of options.

You and Vivienne see him at the same time.

Your eyes meet.

She raises an eyebrow.

You shrug.

**"Together?"** you offer.

**"Together,"** she agrees.

You approach from opposite sides, flanking him, giving him nowhere to run. He sees you both coming, raises his gun, swings it back and forth, unsure who to aim at.

**"Please,"** he begs. **"Please, I was just following orders, I didn't—"**

You shoot him in the right kneecap.

He screams, collapses.

Vivienne stabs him in the left shoulder, pinning him to the floor.

He screams louder.

You crouch down next to him, grab his face, force him to look at you.

**"Who sent you?"** you ask calmly.

**"C-Calabrese,"** he chokes out. **"Marco Calabrese. He wanted both families gone. He—"**

**"Thank you,"** you say.

Then you shoot him between the eyes.

Silence.

The gunfire stops. The screams fade. The cathedral settles into an eerie, blood-soaked quiet. Bodies everywhere. Dozens of them. Attackers. Guests. Collateral.

Your men are securing the perimeter. The Bratva soldiers are checking the dead. Your father is alive, sheltered behind his bodyguards. Viktor Rostov likewise.

The treaty holds.

Barely.

You stand, holster your weapon, and turn to Vivienne.

She's covered in blood head to toe. Her white dress is ruined, drenched crimson, torn in places, clinging to her like a second skin. Her hair is wild, coming loose from whatever style it was in. She has blood on her face, speckled across her cheek like war paint.

She's never looked more beautiful.

**"Final count?"** she asks.

You calculate. **"Twelve. You?"**

**"Ten,"** she admits, sounding almost annoyed.

You grin. **"You owe me drinks."**

She steps closer, close enough to touch, close enough that you can smell the copper-tang of blood mixing with her perfume.

**"Best two out of three?"** she offers.

**"There's going to be a next time?"**

Her smile is slow, predatory, full of dark promise.

**"Husband, with enemies like ours, there's always going to be a next time."**

She's right.

Marco Calabrese just declared war on both families. This was his opening move. There will be retaliation. Escalation. More violence. More bodies.

Most people would be terrified.

You're excited.

And so is she.

You reach out, cup her blood-slick face, and kiss her.

It's nothing like the kiss at the altar.

This one is real.

Raw. Hungry. Teeth and tongue and the taste of gunpowder and death. She kisses you back just as hard, fisting her hands in your ruined jacket, pulling you closer, claiming you the way you claimed her.

When you finally break apart, both breathing hard, she laughs.

**"So,"** she says, **"about that honeymoon..."**

**What do you do?**
