## PROLOGUE: BEFORE THE VOWS

### **DANTE'S PERSPECTIVE**

I don’t believe in fate.

Fate is the word weak men reach for when the weight of their own decisions starts to crush them. A soft excuse. A comforting lie. Something to blame when the bill finally comes due. I don’t believe in destiny or cosmic plans or invisible hands guiding anything. I believe in blood. I believe in leverage. I believe in the precise gravity of a name spoken in the right room at the right moment, and in the way that room goes silent afterward.

My name is Dante Morelli.

If you’ve heard it before, then you already understand why people hesitate when they say it. You already know enough to be afraid.

I was born into violence the way other children are born into comfort. It wasn’t a deviation. It was the default. Violence was my inheritance, my education, my first language. The Morelli family has ruled New York’s underworld for three generations, and I am what comes next. Not the eldest son. That was Antonio, until two bullets ended his claim on a sidewalk outside a Queens restaurant. Not the sharpest mind. That’s Lucia, who turns blood money into clean ledgers and balanced books.

But I am the most dangerous.

I am the one they send when conversation collapses. When deals rot. When mercy is no longer part of the equation. When the message has to be delivered in a way that can’t be misunderstood.

I am beautiful.

I say it the way one acknowledges an undeniable truth, stripped of vanity or hesitation. The way you register the sharpness of a blade before it cuts, or the color of the sky just before a storm breaks. My eyes are blue, pale and cold, the kind that never look away first. My hair is red, catching the light like a warning flare, impossible to unsee once it’s burned into your vision. A face that makes women misplace their caution and men quietly question their own worth.

I have never pursued attention.

It follows me instead, instinctively. The way blood unfurls through water. Slow. Inevitable. Hungry.

And yes, I use it.

Beauty is just another weapon. It opens doors that should stay closed. It lowers defenses people swear they’ll keep up. It convinces them the damage I’m capable of must be exaggerated, theatrical, someone else’s reputation mistaken for mine. By the time they realize otherwise, running is no longer an option. I’ve cut throats while women whispered my name like a secret. I’ve burned enemies alive while their friends stared at my face instead of reaching for their guns. Prettiness. Cruelty. Control. I learned early how to sharpen all three until they were indistinguishable.

My father is dying.

Lung cancer.

Six months, maybe less, according to men who lower their voices and refuse to meet my eyes, as if death might jump from him to them if they’re careless enough. His body is rotting from the inside out, drowning slowly in its own decay, and he knows it. He feels the clock in his chest every time he coughs. Every time blood rises where air should be.

So he has spent the last year doing what dying kings always do.

Strangling uncertainty.

Every loose end has been pulled tight enough to cut. Every potential rival weighed, neutralized, or marked for elimination. Power has been stacked where no one can reach it, layered with threats and favors and blood debts, all designed to survive him. He is building a future that won’t hesitate to devour itself the moment he’s lowered into the ground.

Because succession is never peaceful.

It is a carcass thrown into a pit, and whoever claws their way out alive gets to rule what’s left.

Part of his solution is ending a war that has been feeding on us for nearly a decade. A slow hemorrhage of bodies and money and influence. A conflict that has already taken more than it ever gave back.

He doesn’t want peace.

He wants control that will outlive his corpse.

The Bratva.
The Russian mob.
And, more precisely, the Rostov family.

Viktor Rostov is vicious in the ancient sense of the word. Not impulsive. Not theatrical. The kind of man who learned early that power is built by standing on bodies and never acknowledging the sound they make when they stop breathing. He didn’t climb so much as carve his way upward, leaving a trail of broken men and unfinished graves behind him. Fear is his native language. Death, his punctuation. Anyone who ever stood in his path learned the same lesson: they were temporary. Expendable. Already dead, whether they knew it yet or not.

For years, our families have existed in a state of mutual slaughter. Not chaos. Not rage. Precision. Soldier for soldier. Name for name. A clean, methodical exchange of corpses. An economy of violence that feeds no one and poisons everything it touches. Each retaliation demands another. Each victory rots into weakness. We’ve been bleeding slowly, deliberately, like animals too proud to step away from the trap.

My father, pragmatic down to the bone, finally decided the math no longer worked.

He didn’t mourn the dead. He didn’t rage at the injustice of it all. He simply recognized that the cycle would eventually consume us both, leaving nothing worth inheriting.

So he chose a cleaner solution.

A treaty.

Not written in ink. Written in flesh.

Sealed with a marriage.

His son. Rostov’s daughter.

Me. And her.

I heard her name once.

Vivienne Rostova. Twenty-six. Trained. Dangerous in the way Bratva daughters are taught to be dangerous. Not wild, not reckless, but engineered. Educated in violence the way other women are educated in etiquette. Raised to be useful. Raised to be leverage. Raised with the unspoken understanding that if her value ever diminished, she would be discarded without ceremony.

I was handed a photograph.

Dark hair. Pale skin. High cheekbones. A face composed with deliberate symmetry. Beautiful, in the clinical sense. The kind of beauty that photographs well and bleeds just as easily as anything else.

Beauty means very little in my world.

It’s the most abundant currency there is.

I didn’t ask questions.

I didn’t argue.

This was never meant to be a romance.

It was business. A merger. A calculated binding of two families that would otherwise continue bleeding each other into extinction. A solution born of arithmetic, not sentiment. She would be my wife on paper only, a carefully placed symbol of peace meant to quiet guns and postpone graves.

I would give her a title. A house. A bed she would learn to leave untouched and cold.

In return, I expected silence.

Obedience.

Nothing more.

I expected weakness.

A woman shaped by violence and emptied by it. Someone who learned to survive by complying, by making herself smaller, by folding quietly beneath the will of men who decided her fate without ever asking. Someone who would meet my gaze with fear. Or bitterness. Or that slow, bloodless resignation that kills a person long before the body follows. Someone who would fade into irrelevance the moment the ink dried on the contract.

I expected someone forgettable.

I am, as it turns out, completely wrong.

I just don’t know it yet.

Three hours before my wedding, I’m standing in a warehouse in Brooklyn, executing a man who forgot where his loyalty was supposed to live.

His name is irrelevant. Names lose their value the moment betrayal enters the equation. What matters is the mistake. The choice. The arrogance of thinking consequences can be outsourced.

He sold information to the Calabrese family, convinced himself they could bury him deep enough that my reach would stop at the state line. It didn’t. We tore him out of a safe house in Jersey, bound him while he screamed, let him bleed just enough to stay conscious, and brought him back to the city. Back to where he belonged.

Now he’s on his knees on cold concrete, soaked in his own blood. His hands won’t stop shaking. His eyes are wide with the late, useless understanding that every bad decision is patient, and that it always comes to collect.

“**Please,**” he chokes, voice collapsing in on itself. “**Please, Dante. I have a family. I have—**”

I don’t let him finish.

The bullet enters cleanly between his eyes. No hesitation. No ceremony. The sound snaps through the empty warehouse and hangs there, sharp and final, like the last word in a conversation that ended long before he realized it. His body folds forward, lifeless, as if someone simply turned him off.

One of my men steps forward and drags the corpse away, leaving a dark smear across the floor where he stopped being a problem.

I glance at my watch.

Two hours and forty minutes until the wedding.

I’m still wearing the suit I’ll stand at the altar in. Custom-tailored. Charcoal gray. Italian silk. It was immaculate once. Now it’s flecked with blood, some of it still wet, catching the light when I move, darkening the fabric like a quiet confession. Evidence that hasn’t had time to dry.

I consider changing.

The thought doesn’t survive long enough to matter.

No.

Let her see it. Let her take it in without explanation or apology. Let her understand, immediately and without room for misunderstanding, exactly what she’s agreeing to. Who she’s binding herself to. What kind of man arrives at his own wedding carrying death with him like an accessory.

I want no illusions between us. No softened edges. No polite lies.

I don’t believe in pretense.

If this marriage is going to be a lie, then it will be an honest one—stripped of illusion, soaked in truth, and paid for in blood. No masks. No gentle fiction. Just exactly what we are, standing in full view, daring the world to look away.

### **VIVIENNE'S PERSPECTIVE**

I’ve been dead inside since I was twelve years old.

Not metaphorically. Not poetically. Dead in the clinical sense. Neurologically. The parts of me where empathy, fear, and guilt are supposed to live simply… don’t. I know this because I’ve been tested. Evaluated. Observed under cold lights by men in white coats who asked their careful questions while my brain flickered across monitors. They watched. They measured. And they concluded, with varying degrees of professional distance, that I am a psychopath.

They’re right.

I don’t feel the way other people do. I don’t bond. I don’t attach. I don’t lie awake drowning in regret or shame or yearning for things I’ve lost. I experience the world as a sequence of transactions. Strategic exchanges. Variables to be solved or removed. When emotions surface, they are thin and temporary. Curiosity. Irritation. Boredom. Nothing with roots. Nothing that stays.

My father made me this way.

Viktor Rostov has never been a sentimental man. When I was born, he saw an asset, not a daughter. When my mother died of cancer—when I was six—he saw opportunity. No softness left to interfere. No one to object. He shaped me the way a man shapes a weapon meant to last. Languages. Combat. Seduction. Marksmanship. Poisons. Interrogation. Control. Precision. Obedience to outcome, not morality.

By the time I was twelve, I killed my first target.

A low-level rival skimming money from one of my father’s operations. Insignificant in the larger scheme. Disposable. Necessary.

I remember placing the gun against his head.

I remember pulling the trigger.

I remember feeling nothing.

And I remember my father’s approval, sharp and unmistakable.

**“Good,”** he said. **“No hesitation. That’s my girl.”**

Since then, I’ve killed one hundred and forty-seven people.

I stopped counting after that. Not because of guilt. Guilt never entered the equation. The number simply stopped being interesting. Some deaths were quick. Bullets. Clean. Efficient. Others were slower. Blades. Garrotes. Pain measured carefully when information had to come first. I was good at it. Exceptional. The best, my father would say, though praise from him was rare and always earned in blood.

In certain circles, I became known as Viper.

I didn’t choose the name. I didn’t reject it either. It fit too well.

And then, gradually, inevitably, boredom set in.

Killing lost its edge.

What was once electric and intimate became routine. Procedural. Mechanical. Pull the trigger. Wipe the blade. Move on. There was no challenge left. No risk. No one who could match me, surprise me, or push hard enough to make something stir inside my chest. Nothing that felt even remotely like excitement.

Just emptiness.

And time stretching endlessly in front of me, waiting for something—anything—to finally break the monotony.

I am twenty-six years old, and I am exhausted by my own existence.

Not tired in the way people mean when they complain about long days or sleepless nights. This is deeper than fatigue. It’s the weariness of repetition. Of knowing exactly how every situation will end before it begins. Of moving through life untouched by it, unstimulated, unchanged.

Then my father tells me I’m getting married.

He doesn’t ask. He informs.

An arranged marriage, designed to cauterize a war that’s been bleeding both families dry for years. Dante Morelli. Heir to the Italian mob. A man I’ve never met, but whose reputation travels faster than his shadow. Brutal. Sadistic. Unstable when it serves him, precise when it doesn’t. A killer, like me. A psychopath, most likely, though I doubt anyone ever bothered to diagnose him.

They give me a dossier.

Photographs. Intelligence reports. Behavioral profiles.

He’s beautiful.

Pale blue eyes. Red hair. A face that could belong in a museum or a nightmare, depending on where you’re standing. But beauty doesn’t impress me. Beauty is tactical. It’s leverage. It’s camouflage. It’s a tool, and I understand its mechanics better than most. What holds my attention is the violence threaded through his record. The bodies left behind. The efficiency. The whispers about his appetite for cruelty when restraint no longer serves a purpose.

Most women, I imagine, would be terrified.

I’m intrigued.

Not because I expect kindness. Not because I’m foolish enough to romanticize what this is. This isn’t love, and it isn’t partnership. It’s curiosity. Sharp and unfamiliar. The kind I haven’t felt in years. I wonder if he’s truly as dangerous as they claim. I wonder if he’ll bore me the way everyone else eventually does. I wonder if he’ll fracture when I test him—and I will test him—or if he’ll push back hard enough to make things interesting.

I agree without protest.

My father is visibly surprised. He’d anticipated resistance. Negotiation. Perhaps even defiance. Instead, I nod once and ask when the wedding is.

“**Two weeks,**” he says.

**“Fine.”**

He watches me for a long moment, searching for something he’s never managed to find. Fear. Resentment. Doubt. Anything recognizably human. He comes up empty, as always.

“**You understand what this means,**” he says carefully. “**You’ll belong to him. To the Morelli family. You’ll be expected to—**”

**“I understand,”** I cut in. **“I’ll play the role.”**

I always do.

And then the day of the wedding arrives.

I’m dressed in white.

The gown is custom-made, elegant, traditional down to every deliberate stitch. It fits perfectly, which only makes it feel more like a costume. That’s appropriate. This is theater. A performance staged for power and appearances. I’ll stand at an altar, recite vows that mean nothing, and legally bind myself to a man I’ve never met.

And then I’ll see what he’s made of.

The ceremony takes place in a cathedral in Manhattan. Neutral ground. Sacred stone temporarily borrowed by men who kill for a living. Both families are present, along with their respective entourages, an uneasy peace maintained by mutual self-interest and loaded guns beneath tailored jackets. I take my place at the altar and wait.

He’s late.

Ten minutes.
Fifteen.
Twenty.

A low murmur spreads through the pews like a nervous infection. My father’s jaw tightens, the muscle ticking beneath his skin. The priest shifts his weight, sweat gathering at his collar. I remain perfectly still, unbothered. Lateness is information. Either a delay beyond his control or a deliberate assertion of power. Both are instructive.

Then the doors open.

Dante Morelli steps inside.

He’s wearing a charcoal-gray suit, immaculately tailored, the kind of craftsmanship that announces money before he ever speaks.

It’s covered in blood.

Fresh. Still darkening the fabric in places. Flecked across his chest and sleeves. A careless smear along his jaw, as if violence followed him here and he couldn’t be bothered to wash it off. He walks down the aisle without haste, without apology, pale blue eyes sweeping the cathedral with the calm confidence of a man who already owns the room.

Everything stops.

My father’s men tense, hands drifting just a little closer to concealed weapons. The Morelli soldiers remain motionless, unreadable. The priest looks like he might be sick.

And I smile.

Not politely.
Not nervously.

A real smile.

Because for the first time in a very, very long time, something sharp and electric sparks to life inside me.

Interest.

He reaches the altar and stops in front of me. Our eyes lock, and for a suspended moment, neither of us speaks. He studies me the way I study him. Measuring. Weighing. Calculating risk and reward.

“**You’re late,**” I say, my voice calm.

**“Needed to take care of something.”** he replies.

**“I can see that.”**

The corner of his mouth lifts, not quite a smile. “**Does it bother you?**”

**“No.”**

**“Good.”**

The priest clears his throat, eager to move forward before this becomes something else entirely.

**“Shall we begin?”** he asks, his voice thin.

Dante doesn’t look away from me.

**“Let’s.”**

---

### **THE UNSPOKEN TRUTH**

What neither of us says, standing at the altar beneath vaulted stone and watching eyes, beneath God and the brittle treaty stitching our families together, is this:

We recognize each other.

Not romantically. Not in the childish sense of fate or soulmates or stars aligning just so. There is nothing poetic about it.

It’s instinct.

The way predators identify their own across a distance. The way something old and precise wakes up and pays attention.

He sees the emptiness in me immediately. The absence behind the smile. The cold arithmetic running beneath my calm. He understands, without needing it explained, that what looks like composure is simply lack of fear.

I see the chaos in him. The violence coiled so tightly it looks like control. He wears it naturally, like a second skin, like something that has never known how to be removed.

Most people would recoil from this realization.

Most people would feel the warning and step back.

We lean in.

This marriage was meant to be a strategy. A merger. A calculated move to stop the bleeding before it destroyed us all.

It isn’t going to be that.

It’s going to be far worse.

And far, far better.

---

## THE WORLD

**Setting:** New York City, present day  
**Power Structure:**
- **Morelli Family (Italian Mob):** Controls trafficking, loan sharking, protection rackets, legitimate businesses (restaurants, construction)
- **Rostov Bratva (Russian Mob):** Controls arms dealing, human trafficking, cybercrime, money laundering

**The War:** The two families have been killing each other for a decade over territorial disputes. Both are weakened. Both are bleeding resources. The marriage is a truce, but truces in this world are fragile things, held together by self-interest and the threat of mutually assured destruction.

**The Stakes:** If the marriage fails, the war resumes. If either family shows weakness, rival factions (Calabrese, Yakuza, Triads) will move in. Both Dante and Vivienne understand this. Neither particularly cares. They're more interested in each other.

---

## THEMES

- **Violence as intimacy:** For Dante and Vivienne, violence isn't just a tool—it's a language, a form of connection
- **Toxicity as compatibility:** They're not good for each other. They're perfect for each other. There's a difference.
- **Power dynamics:** Constant struggle for control, neither willing to submit, both thriving in the push-and-pull
- **The void:** What happens when two people incapable of love find the only person who understands that emptiness?

---

## TONE & STYLE

**Narrative Voice:** Second person (You are Dante) for immersion and complicity  
**Prose Style:** Sharp, visceral, unflinching. No romanticizing the violence. No apologizing for the characters.  
**Pacing:** Slow burn tension punctuated by explosive moments (literal and metaphorical)  
**Content Warnings:** Extreme violence, murder, morally bankrupt protagonists, toxic relationship dynamics, sexual content, psychological manipulation

---

## NOW WE BEGIN

The priest finishes the vows.

There’s a pause. The kind heavy with expectation. Tradition dictates the next move.

You’re supposed to kiss your bride.

Vivienne looks up at you, waiting. There’s no tremor in her gaze. No nerves. No soft anticipation. Just cool, clinical curiosity, sharp enough to cut. She’s watching you the way she’d watch a weapon being drawn. Interested in how you’ll use it.

You step closer.

The blood on your suit smears against the white of her gown, a dark, intimate stain blooming where it shouldn’t. A desecration, some would call it.

She doesn’t flinch.

You lift a hand and cup her face. Your knuckles are still bruised, skin split and tender from earlier. From breaking a man open piece by piece until the truth spilled out, and then ending him. The marks are fresh. Honest.

Her skin beneath your palm is cold.

You kiss her.

It isn’t gentle.
It isn’t reverent.
It isn’t romantic.

It’s a claim.

A challenge issued mouth to mouth. Pressure and intent and the unmistakable promise of violence wrapped in intimacy. You take, not ask. You test, not soothe.

When you pull back, she’s smiling.

Not shaken.
Not offended.
Not surprised.

**“Hello, husband,”** she says, voice smooth, almost amused.

**“Hello, wife.”**

The crowd applauds, hesitant at first, then louder. Relief ripples through them. No shots fired. No blood spilled at the altar. A successful ceremony, by their standards.

You don’t let go of her face.

You lean in just enough that only she can hear you.

**“Are you going to be trouble?”** you ask.

Her smile widens, slow and deliberate, eyes gleaming with something dark and delighted.

**“I’m going to be the best trouble you’ve ever had.”**

---

You don't let go of her face.

If anything, your grip tightens. Not enough to hurt her. Never that. Just enough to anchor her there, to make sure she feels you. To make sure she understands this moment is real, that it belongs to both of you. Your thumb drags along the sharp line of her jaw, slow, deliberate, unmistakably possessive.

**"Prove it,"** you murmur, your voice pitched low, meant for her alone.

Her eyes don't widen. They don't soften. They ignite.

Not fear.
Interest.

**"Somewhere private,"** she says smoothly. **"I want to see if you bleed as pretty as you smile."**

She steps closer, presses herself against you harder, deliberately invading your space, daring you to react. She's about to say something else when it happens.

A sound that does not belong in a cathedral.

Glass explodes.

Not cracks. Not trembles. It detonates, stained-glass saints obliterated in an instant, colored shards raining down across marble and silk. Screams tear through the air, sharp and frantic, immediately drowned out by the clean, brutal crack of gunfire echoing through stone and vaulted ceilings.

Someone is shooting up your wedding.

Instinct moves before thought can catch up. You act fast, ruthless, exact. You shove Vivienne down and cover her with your body as bullets rip through what remains of the windows, turning holy icons into glittering wreckage. Chaos erupts. Your men draw weapons. Her father's soldiers return fire. Guests scatter, slipping on polished marble, diving beneath pews like prey animals fleeing a slaughter.

But Vivienne doesn't cower beneath you.

She laughs.

You feel it first, a subtle vibration against your chest. Dark. Delighted. Genuine joy, untouched by the violence tearing the room apart.

**"This is perfect,"** she says, bright and almost giddy, her voice edged with something beautifully unhinged.

A blade flashes.

She produces a knife from somewhere inside her wedding dress. You didn't see it. Didn't sense it. Didn't even consider that she might be armed. She tilts her head up toward you, and for the first time since you met her, her eyes are fully awake. Sharp. Alive. Hungry.

**"So,"** she says lightly, over gunfire and screams, **"do we kill them together, or do we make this a competition?"**

Three realizations hit you all at once.

Your wedding is under attack, likely Calabrese, aiming to erase both heirs in a single, efficient massacre.
Your wife is armed, dangerous, and savoring every second of it.
And somewhere between shattered glass and blood-slick marble, you realize you might actually be in love.

**"Competition,"** you decide.

Your voice is calm. Certain.

**"Whoever kills more buys drinks tonight."**

Her grin turns feral. Beautiful. A promise written in blood.

**"You're on, husband."**

---

## CHAPTER 1: THE BLOOD WEDDING

### DANTE

You roll off her and move.

No hesitation. No wasted motion. Just pure, efficient violence.

Your gun is already in your hand—Beretta M9, custom grip, fifteen rounds—pulled from the shoulder holster beneath your blood-stained jacket. You don't remember drawing it. Muscle memory. Instinct older than thought.

A gunman bursts through the side entrance, tactical gear, ski mask, AR-15 raised. Calabrese colors on his vest. Sloppy. Arrogant. He thinks he's walking into a massacre.

He's right.

Just not his.

You put two rounds center mass before he clears the doorway. He drops, choking on his own blood, weapon clattering across marble. 

**One.**

You don't stop moving.

The cathedral has become a warzone. Your soldiers and the Bratva forces have taken defensive positions, returning fire at the attackers pouring in from multiple entrances. Guests are screaming, crawling, dying. You don't care about them. Collateral damage. Background noise.

What you care about is the body count.

And your wife.

You glance back.

Vivienne is already moving, low and fast, white dress dragging through broken glass and pooling blood. She doesn't run for cover. She runs *toward* the fight.

A gunman rounds the corner near the altar, weapon sweeping for targets.

He never sees her coming.

She closes the distance impossibly fast, a blur of white silk and dark intent. Her knife—thin, professional, probably Russian military issue—flashes once. Twice. Three times. Throat. Kidney. Femoral artery. Precision cuts, each one fatal, executed in less than two seconds.

The man collapses, gurgling, drowning in arterial spray.

She doesn't even look down at him.

**"One,"** she calls out, voice bright, almost singing it.

You can't help it.

You smile.

She nearly trips.

The dress is wrong for this. Too much fabric, too much weight, silk catching where it shouldn't, slowing her by half a second. Half a second is enough in a gunfight.

You see it instantly.

You grab her and pull her in, fast and hard, intending to shield her, to move her out of the line of fire but momentum betrays you. She slams into your chest, closer than planned, closer than smart. Way too close.

Her lips stop inches from yours.

Not a kiss. Not quite. Just breath and heat and chaos.

Both of you are breathing hard. Gunfire cracks behind you. Marble chips explode at your feet. Somewhere, someone screams. But right here, for a suspended, impossible second, the world narrows to the space between your mouths.

You brush her by accident. A bare graze. Enough to be felt. Enough to be noticed.

Her eyes lock onto yours.

No fear. No hesitation.

Recognition.

The kind that hits like impact, sharp and electric, like you've both just realized you're standing in the same storm and neither of you plans to step back.

**"Dress,"** you mutter, low, almost a growl.

Before she can answer, you move.

You take the knife from her hand in one smooth motion, fingers closing around the grip as you pivot behind her, body pressed to her back for a split second longer than necessary. She doesn't resist. Doesn't protest. Trusts you without asking why.

You spin her, fast and controlled, and slash.

Fabric gives way under the blade. Silk tears open with a vicious sound, the skirt of her wedding gown splitting clean, freeing her legs, stripping the dress of its restraint. Another cut. Then another. Practical. Precise. No wasted motion.

She inhales sharply, not from fear.

From thrill.

You step back just enough to finish, eyes never leaving hers as you flick the blade, testing its balance once.

Then you press the knife back into her palm.

Handle first.

Her fingers close around it instantly, like it never left her, like this is exactly where it belongs.

She smiles at you then.

Not sweet. Not soft.

Dangerously intimate.

**"About time,"** she says, rolling her shoulders, newly free, blood and silk brushing the marble. **"Now I can move."**

Gunfire erupts again, closer this time.

You lean in, just enough for her to hear you over the chaos.

**"Try not to slow me down,"** you murmur.

Her eyes burn.

**"Don't worry,"** she replies. **"I'll make it hard for you to keep up."**

Then she turns, dress ruined, knife gleaming, and dives straight back into the violence like it's a dance she was born knowing.

Another attacker appears on your left, firing wild, panicked. Amateur. You sidestep, let the bullets pass where you were standing a heartbeat ago, and return fire. Single shot. Headshot. Brain matter decorates the stained glass behind him.

**Two.**

A third comes from the right. You pivot, fire twice. Chest. Throat. He goes down hard, weapon skittering away.

**Three.**

Movement in your peripheral vision.

Vivienne has engaged two attackers simultaneously. One tries to grab her—stupid, suicidal—and she lets him. Uses his momentum against him, spins inside his guard, and drives her blade up under his ribs, angling toward his heart. Textbook kill. He gasps, eyes wide, and she holds him there for a moment, watching the light fade.

Then she shoves him away and turns on the second attacker.

He raises his gun.

She's faster.

She throws her knife.

It embeds in his eye socket with a wet, meaty sound, punching through to his brain. He drops instantly, dead before he hits the ground.

**"Three,"** she announces, walking calmly to retrieve her blade, pulling it free with a wet *schlik* that echoes despite the gunfire.

You're losing.

Unacceptable.

You spot a cluster of three gunmen advancing down the center aisle, firing in controlled bursts, professional, coordinated. Calabrese elite. Trained. Dangerous.

Not dangerous enough.

You break from cover, sprinting directly at them.

They see you coming. Adjust aim. Fire.

You're already moving, serpentine pattern, making yourself an impossible target. Bullets crack past your head, close enough to feel the displaced air. One grazes your shoulder, tearing fabric, drawing blood.

You don't slow down.

At ten feet, you slide, marble slick with blood, dropping beneath their line of fire. You come up between them, inside their guard, too close for their rifles to track effectively.

Gun to the first one's temple. Fire.

**Four.**

Spin. Elbow strike to the second's throat, crushing his windpipe. He drops, choking, dying slow.

**Five.**

The third tries to swing his rifle like a club. You catch it, redirect the momentum, and use it to pull him off balance. Your gun comes up under his chin. Fire.

**Six.**

The body crumples.

You look up.

Vivienne is standing on top of a pew, elevated, surveying the chaos like a queen surveying her kingdom. Her white dress is soaked red now, impossible to tell how much is hers and how much belongs to others. Probably none of it is hers.

An attacker tries to flank her from behind.

She doesn't turn around.

She just steps backward off the pew, letting gravity do the work, and drops onto him. Her weight drives him down, and her knife is already moving. She stabs him repeatedly—face, neck, chest—each strike precise, clinical, overkill in the most literal sense.

When she stands, she's smiling.

**"Six,"** she says, meeting your eyes across the cathedral.

Tied.

**"Not for long,"** you reply.

The main doors explode inward—not kicked, not shot, literally blown apart with breaching charges. Smoke and splinters fill the air. More gunmen pour through, at least a dozen, heavily armed, organized.

This was planned. Coordinated. A full-scale assassination attempt.

They didn't account for one thing.

Neither of you wants to leave.

You want to *play.*

You reload without looking, muscle memory, mag out, fresh mag in, chamber a round. Fourteen bullets. Fourteen more kills, if you're efficient.

Vivienne has retrieved a second knife from somewhere—maybe off one of the bodies, maybe she had two all along—and she's dual-wielding now, blades reversed, edges out. Combat stance. Feral grace.

She looks at you.

You look at her.

No words needed.

You both move at the same time.

The gunmen spread out, trying to establish crossfire, trying to corner you both. They're thinking tactically, professionally. They're treating this like a military operation.

Mistake.

This isn't war.

This is hunting season.

You take the left flank. Six targets. You move through them like a scalpel through flesh. Shoot, move, shoot, move. No wasted shots. No hesitation. Each kill is efficient, necessary, beautiful in its simplicity.

Headshot. **Seven.**
Double-tap center mass. **Eight.**
Kneecap, then execution shot when he falls. **Nine.**

Behind you, Vivienne is dancing.

There's no other word for it. She flows between attackers like water, blades flashing, always moving, never where they expect. She cuts tendons, severs arteries, destroys joints. Not killing immediately, but ensuring death comes soon, inevitably, painfully.

A man screams as she opens his stomach, his insides spilling onto sacred ground.

**"Seven,"** she counts.

Another drops, throat opened, choking on blood.

**"Eight."**

You catch movement in the choir loft—sniper, trying to get a high angle. Smart. Dangerous.

You fire three shots upward. The first two miss. The third catches him in the shoulder, spinning him around. He falls from the loft, twenty feet down, lands hard. Bones crack audibly.

You walk over. Put a round in his skull.

**Ten.**

A gunman tries to surrender, dropping his weapon, raising his hands.

**"Wait, wait, please—"**

Vivienne doesn't wait.

She's on him before he finishes the sentence, knife buried in his throat. She holds him there, watching his eyes as he dies, studying him like a specimen.

**"Nine,"** she whispers.

You're still ahead.

The remaining attackers are retreating now, realizing this isn't going according to plan, that the targets are hunting *them.* They fall back toward the exits, firing wildly, desperately.

You let them run.

Then you shoot them in the back.

**Eleven. Twelve.**

Vivienne throws one of her knives. It spins end over end, perfect rotation, and embeds between a fleeing attacker's shoulder blades. He stumbles, falls, doesn't get back up.

**"Ten,"** she says.

One gunman left.

He's trapped behind an overturned pew, pinned down by covering fire from your men. Terrified. Alone. Out of options.

You and Vivienne see him at the same time.

Your eyes meet.

She raises an eyebrow.

You shrug.

**"Together?"** you offer.

**"Together,"** she agrees.

You approach from opposite sides, flanking him, giving him nowhere to run. He sees you both coming, raises his gun, swings it back and forth, unsure who to aim at.

**"Please,"** he begs. **"Please, I was just following orders, I didn't—"**

You shoot him in the right kneecap.

He screams, collapses.

Vivienne stabs him in the left shoulder, pinning him to the floor.

He screams louder.

You crouch down next to him, grab his face, force him to look at you.

**"Who sent you?"** you ask calmly.

**"C-Calabrese,"** he chokes out. **"Marco Calabrese. He wanted both families gone. He—"**

**"Thank you,"** you say.

Then you shoot him between the eyes.

Silence.

The gunfire stops. The screams fade. The cathedral settles into an eerie, blood-soaked quiet. Bodies everywhere. Dozens of them. Attackers. Guests. Collateral.

Your men are securing the perimeter. The Bratva soldiers are checking the dead. Your father is alive, sheltered behind his bodyguards. Viktor Rostov likewise.

The treaty holds.

Barely.

You stand, holster your weapon, and turn to Vivienne.

She's covered in blood head to toe. Her white dress is ruined, drenched crimson, torn in places, clinging to her like a second skin. Her hair is wild, coming loose from whatever style it was in. She has blood on her face, speckled across her cheek like war paint.

She's never looked more beautiful.

**"Final count?"** she asks.

You calculate. **"Twelve. You?"**

**"Ten,"** she admits, sounding almost annoyed.

You grin. **"You owe me drinks."**

She steps closer, close enough to touch, close enough that you can smell the copper-tang of blood mixing with her perfume.

**"Best two out of three?"** she offers.

**"There's going to be a next time?"**

Her smile is slow, predatory, full of dark promise.

**"Husband, with enemies like ours, there's always going to be a next time."**

She's right.

Marco Calabrese just declared war on both families. This was his opening move. There will be retaliation. Escalation. More violence. More bodies.

Most people would be terrified.

You're excited.

And so is she.

You reach out, cup her blood-slick face, and kiss her.

It's nothing like the kiss at the altar.

This one is real.

Raw. Hungry. Teeth and tongue and the taste of gunpowder and death. She kisses you back just as hard, fisting her hands in your ruined jacket, pulling you closer, claiming you the way you claimed her.

When you finally break apart, both breathing hard, she laughs.

**"So,"** she says, **"about that honeymoon..."**

---

I can't get enough of that kiss.

I know she feels it too. I see it in the way her breath hasn't settled, in the way her gaze keeps finding my mouth like it belongs there. For the first time, something unfamiliar coils low in my chest.

Hunger.

Not the old kind. Not power. Not money. Not blood or territory or legacy.

Her.

It hits harder than anything that's ever driven me. Sharper. More dangerous. A craving that doesn't want to conquer, only to claim. To keep.

I'm dimly aware of the room again. Of eyes on us. Both families watching, measuring, counting breaths, making sure their prized heirs are still standing. Guns lowered, fingers tense, violence paused on a knife's edge.

They're worried about survival.

We're distracted by something else entirely.

By each other.

It's almost absurd how little anything else matters.

Without asking, without explaining, I slip an arm beneath her knees and lift her, bridal-style. The motion is instinctive, possessive, final. She doesn't protest. Doesn't tense. Her arm slides around my neck like this is where she was always meant to be.

The room parts as I start walking.

I don't look at anyone. Not my men. Not her father. Not the bodies, the blood, the shattered glass underfoot. None of it registers. The world narrows again, this time to the weight of her in my arms, the heat of her body, the way her fingers curl slightly into my shoulder like she's anchoring herself there.

Or anchoring me.

We move through the wreckage like the destruction was staged for us, like the blood and broken glass are nothing more than decoration. Chaos bends out of our way. People freeze, watching, knowing better than to interfere. Whatever rules still exist in this room do not apply to us anymore.

She shifts in my arms, slow and intentional. Not to get comfortable. To make sure I feel her. Her thigh presses closer. Her fingers tighten at the back of my neck, nails grazing skin just enough to warn me.

Her head tilts. Her mouth drifts to my ear, not touching, not yet. Heat radiates from her like a promise she has no intention of keeping gentle.

“**Where are we going?**” she asks, voice low, intimate, dangerous.

My jaw tightens. My grip adjusts, firmer now, unmistakably claiming. I lean just enough that my breath brushes her ear when I answer.

“**Somewhere private,**” I say. “**Somewhere no one will interrupt what happens next.**”

Her laugh slips out, soft and dark, satisfaction threaded through it. The sound sinks straight into my bloodstream.

“**Good**,” she murmurs.

I don’t slow.

I don’t hesitate.

I walk past bodies, past guns, past men who would die for us without understanding why. The only thing that matters is the weight of her in my arms, the tension coiled between us, the certainty that once we’re alone, restraint is no longer part of the equation.

Whatever just ignited between us doesn’t want witnesses.

It wants consequences.

## CHAPTER 2: THE HONEYMOON

### DANTE

The car is waiting outside. Black Mercedes S-Class, bulletproof, windows tinted so dark you can't see inside even in daylight. My driver opens the door without a word, trained not to ask questions, trained not to see things he shouldn't.

I slide into the backseat with Vivienne still in my arms, door slamming shut behind us.

Privacy. Finally.

The partition between us and the driver is already up. Soundproof. We could scream and he wouldn't hear a thing.

I set her down on the leather seat, but I don't move away. Can't. My hand stays on her waist, fingers pressing into ruined silk and the warm skin beneath.

She looks at me, eyes bright, dangerous, fully alive.

**"So,"** she says. **"Twelve to ten. You won."**

**"I did."**

**"What do you want as your prize?"**

I lean in, close enough that my lips brush her ear.

**"Everything,"** I whisper.

Her breath catches. Just barely. But I hear it.

The car starts moving, pulling away from the cathedral, from the bodies, from the witnesses. Heading toward my estate on the outskirts of the city. Forty-five minutes in traffic.

We don't make it five.

She moves first.

Her hands fist in my jacket, fingers digging into blood-soaked fabric like she’s anchoring herself to something real, something alive. Then she yanks me in with brutal strength, no warning, no patience. Her mouth crashes into mine, teeth catching, breath colliding, hunger stripped bare.

It isn’t soft.
It isn’t careful.

It’s a claim.

A violent, unapologetic assertion that whatever this is, it’s already hers as much as it is mine.

I kiss her back just as fiercely, meeting her aggression without flinching. My hand slides up to her throat, fingers settling there with deliberate restraint. I don’t squeeze. I don’t need to. I just hold her, feel her pulse hammering wild and fast beneath my palm.

Alive.
Eager.
Unmistakably thrilled.

She bites my lower lip hard enough to break skin.

Pain blooms sharp and perfect.

I smile against her mouth.

**"Careful,"** I murmur.

**"Or what?"** she challenges, breathless.

I tighten my grip on her throat just enough to make a point.

**"Or I'll show you exactly how rough I can be."**

Her eyes flash with something that isn't fear.

It's anticipation.

**"Prove it,"** she says.

So I do.

I kiss her again, harder this time, unrestrained, letting her feel exactly what she does to me. My other hand slides down, finding the torn fabric of her dress, the bare skin of her thigh where I cut the silk away. She gasps into my mouth, and I swallow the sound, greedy for it.

Her hands are everywhere. Tugging at my jacket, my shirt, fingers sliding through blood and fabric, searching for skin. She finds it, nails dragging down my chest, sharp enough to sting.

Good.

I want her marks on me.

The car hits a bump and we're thrown together, bodies colliding, and suddenly she's in my lap, straddling me, ruined wedding dress hiked up around her hips, thighs bracketing mine.

We're both still covered in blood.

Neither of us cares.

**"You know what I thought,"** she says, breathless, lips swollen, **"when I first saw you at the altar?"**

**"What?"**

**"That you were the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen."**

I raise an eyebrow. **"Thing?"**

**"Not a person,"** she clarifies, voice dropping lower, darker. **"A thing. A weapon. Something built to destroy."**

**"And now?"**

She leans in, lips brushing mine, not quite kissing, just breathing the same air.

**"Now I want to see if you break,"** she whispers. **"Or if you'll break me first."**

Fuck.

This woman is going to ruin me.

Or I'm going to ruin her.

Maybe both.

The car slows. Turns. Gravel crunches beneath the tires, familiar and final. I don’t need to look out the window to know where we are. The gates of my estate are opening for us.

Two minutes.
Maybe less.

I don’t wait.

My hands lock onto her hips, firm, commanding, halting her movement completely. I hold her there, grounded, owned by the moment, and force her to look at me.

Her eyes snap up, bright and dangerous, breath already uneven.

Everything else fades. The driver. The guards. The gates sliding shut behind us.

There is only the space between our bodies, the tension stretched tight enough to snap, and the promise that once the car stops, restraint will be nothing but a memory.

**"Last chance to change your mind,"** I say. **"Once we're inside, I'm not stopping. I'm not gentle. I'm not careful. You understand?"**

She smiles.

Not wide. Not innocent. Just a slow, knowing curve of her mouth that promises damage.

It’s the most dangerous thing I’ve ever seen.

**"Dante,"** she says, **"if you're gentle, I'll be disappointed."**

The car comes to a stop.

The door opens.

I don’t wait for the driver to move. I don’t acknowledge him at all. I lift Vivienne again, decisive, effortless, and carry her out of the car like the world is already finished with its objections.

Straight toward the house.

My house.
The Morelli estate.

Thirty rooms. Fifteen bathrooms. Layers of security designed to repel a small army. Walls that have seen blood, deals, betrayals, and power traded like currency.

None of it matters.

Not the guards. Not the gates sealing shut behind us. Not the history soaked into every stone.

The only thing that matters now is distance.

Closing it.
Erasing it.

Getting her alone.

The staff scatters the moment I step inside, trained instincts kicking in, bodies vanishing down corridors without a word. Good. I don’t want eyes. I don’t want questions. I don’t want anything that breathes between us and what comes next.

I take the stairs two at a time, not slowing, not careful. Vivienne’s arms are locked around my neck, tight, possessive. Her face presses into my throat, lips brushing my pulse with deliberate precision, just enough to make concentration slip, just enough to remind me she knows exactly what she’s doing.

My bedroom.
Master suite.
Top floor.

Privacy. Control.

I kick the door open, carry her inside without breaking stride, and slam it shut behind us with my heel.

The lock clicks.

Final. Absolute.

We’re alone.

Finally.

I set her down, and for a moment, we just stand there, breathing hard, staring at each other. Blood-soaked. Battle-worn. Married for less than an hour and already bound by something darker than vows.

**"So,"** she says, reaching up to touch my face, fingers tracing my jaw. **"What now, husband?"**

I catch her wrist and pull her hand away, stopping her mid-movement. I pin it behind her back, precise and deliberate.

Not rough.
Not cruel.

Just firm.
Just controlled.

Enough to make the message unmistakable.

**"Now,"** I say, voice low and dangerous, **"I find out if you're as dangerous as you pretend to be."**

Her smile is sharp as a blade, all edge and intent, the kind that promises damage long before it ever draws blood.

**"Try me."**

---

### VIVIENNE

He kisses me like he’s trying to devour me.

Like hunger finally given permission to exist. Like restraint snapping clean in half and being thrown away without regret. His hand fists in my hair, grip tight, controlling the angle, dictating the pace.

I let him.

Not because I yield.
Because I want to know how far he’ll push before I turn it against him.

His other hand trails down my spine, slow, deliberate, unmissable. He finds the zipper of what’s left of my dress and pulls it down in one smooth, decisive motion. No hesitation. No ceremony. Fabric slips away from my body, whispering as it pools at my feet.

Exposed.

I should feel vulnerable.

I don’t.

I feel powerful.

Because the way he’s looking at me tells me everything.

Like I’m something sacred and obscene at the same time. Like a sin dressed up as salvation. His gaze doesn’t roam. It locks. Sharp. Reverent. Ruined.

He wants me.

Not as a wife.
Not as a treaty.
Not as a symbol traded between men who mistake power for control.

He wants me as the one thing he can’t tame. Can’t read. Can’t bend to his will no matter how hard he tries.

Something volatile.
Unpredictable.
Dangerous enough to ruin him if he missteps.

Good.

**"Your turn,"** I say, tugging at his shirt.

He releases me only long enough to strip away the barriers.

His jacket shrugs off his shoulders. Buttons come undone. The shirt slips free and falls to the floor like it never mattered. His chest is revealed in full, a brutal map of violence and survival. Old scars cut across muscle, pale and permanent. New bruises bloom dark beneath the skin. And there, unmistakable, the fresh graze where a bullet brushed him earlier, close enough to remind him how thin the margin was.

I press my palm against it.

Heat. Tension. Life.

He hisses, sharp and involuntary, the sound tearing from him before control can catch it.

And the knowledge settles deep in my bones.

I affect him.

**"Hurt?"** I ask.

**"Somewhat."**

I press harder.

**"Good."**

His eyes darken, something feral flickering behind that cold blue, a predator surfacing just beneath the surface. He doesn’t warn me. He grabs me, lifts me effortlessly, and suddenly my back hits the wall, solid and unyielding, his body caging me there.

He presses in close.

Too close.

His mouth finds my throat, teeth scraping skin in a way that isn’t gentle and isn’t meant to be. A promise disguised as a threat.

I gasp, the sound tearing out of me as my nails dig into his shoulders, breaking skin, drawing blood. I don’t pull back. I hold tighter.

He groans against my neck, low and rough, the sound vibrating straight through me, and it’s—

Perfect.

This. This is what I wanted. What I’ve been circling around for years without knowing how to name it. Someone who doesn’t flinch when I push. Doesn’t shatter when I bite back. Someone who doesn’t treat me like glass or a monster to be feared.

Someone who meets me exactly where I stand.

Someone who matches me.

**"Dante,"** I breathe.

**"Say it again,"** he demands, voice rough.

**"Dante."**

He bites down.

Not hard enough to truly hurt. Never that. Just enough to leave intent behind, just enough to claim skin and memory. The sensation detonates through me, sharp and electric, and my body arches instinctively against his, pleasure spiking fast and uncontrollable.

This is insane.

This is perfect.

This is—

He pulls back suddenly.

Breathing hard. Controlled barely holding. His eyes lock onto mine, dark and burning, like he’s just realized the same thing I have.

That whatever this is, it’s already gone too far to be undone.

**"Bed,"** he says. **"Now."**

**"Make me."**

His smile is pure danger.

**"Gladly."**

He carries me to the bed.

Massive. King-size. Black silk sheets stretched tight and waiting. He drops me onto it without ceremony. I bounce once, a breathless laugh tearing free before I can stop it.

And then he’s on me.

Immediately.

His body covers mine, weight settling in, solid and unavoidable. He pins me down, hands braced on either side of my head, heat and tension locking us together as the last trace of distance disappears.

The air between us goes tight.

There’s no gentleness in the way he holds me. No hesitation either. Just certainty. Just intent.

And beneath it all, the unmistakable promise that this is only the beginning.

**"You're used to being in control,"** he says, voice low, lips brushing mine. **"Aren't you?"**

**"Always."**

**"Not here."** His hand wraps around my throat again, gentle but firm. **"Not with me."**

I could fight him.

I know exactly how. I’m trained for it. A dozen techniques rise to the surface instinctively, muscle memory whispering options. A shift of weight. A hooked leg. A sharp twist of the wrist. I could reverse the pin, put him beneath me, remind him just how dangerous I am.

But I don’t.

Because for the first time in my life, I don’t want to.

Something about the way he holds me, the way his control isn’t frantic or insecure but deliberate, earned, makes my instincts quiet instead of scream. He doesn’t need to dominate me to prove anything. He already has my attention. My interest. My consent.

And that’s new.

Terrifying.
Intoxicating.

For once, I want to see what happens if I let go. If I stop calculating exits and counters and simply allow him to take control. To feel what it’s like to surrender not because I’m weaker, but because I choose to.

He makes me want that.

And that, more than anything, is what makes him dangerous.

**"Then take it,"** I whisper.

And he does.

---

### DANTE

I kiss her like I'm claiming territory.

Hard. Deep. Consuming. My hand tightens around her throat, not to hurt—never to hurt—but to feel her pulse racing beneath my palm, wild and uncontrolled, proof that she's as affected by this as I am.

She gasps into my mouth and I swallow the sound, greedy, starving for every response I can pull from her.

Her nails rake down my back, sharp enough to draw blood, and the pain spikes bright and perfect. I groan against her lips, the sound torn from somewhere deep, and she laughs—breathless, dark, victorious.

**"You like that,"** she says. Not a question.

**"Yes."**

**"Good."**

She does it again. Harder this time. Ten lines of fire scoring down my spine, deliberate, possessive, marking me the way I'm marking her.

I pull back just enough to look at her. Flushed. Wild. Eyes bright with something that isn't fear or hesitation but pure, unfiltered hunger.

Beautiful.

Dangerous.

Mine.

The thought surprises me. I don't do possessive. I don't do attachment. But looking at her now—lips swollen, hair tangled, blood still smeared on her skin from the cathedral—I want to brand her. Make it impossible for anyone else to ever touch what's mine.

**"My turn,"** I say, voice rougher than intended.

I shift my weight, pin her wrists above her head with one hand, and use my free hand to map her body. Slow. Deliberate. Learning every curve, every scar, every place that makes her breath hitch.

She's a landscape of violence. A scar along her ribs—knife wound, old, probably from training. Another on her shoulder—bullet graze. Marks of a life lived in the shadows, same as mine.

I trace each one with my fingers, then my mouth.

**"This one?"** I ask, lips against the scar on her ribs.

**"Bratva enforcer. I was fourteen. He underestimated me."**

**"Mistake."**

**"His last one."**

I smile against her skin and move lower.

She arches against me, testing my grip, and I tighten it.

**"Stay still,"** I order.

**"Make me."**

Challenge accepted.

I lean down, press my mouth to the hollow of her throat where her pulse hammers visibly, and bite. Not breaking skin. Just pressure. Just enough to make her gasp and go rigid beneath me.

**"Dante—"**

I don't let her finish. My free hand slides lower, exploring with purpose, and her protest dissolves into a sound that's half gasp, half moan.

Perfect.

I want to learn every sound she makes. Catalog them. Know exactly what earns a gasp versus a moan versus that sharp intake of breath that means I've found something that undoes her.

Then I move lower.

Collarbone—I bite there too, leaving a mark that will bloom purple by morning.

Shoulder—her breath hitches.

The curve of her breast—she arches into me.

Each touch earns a response. A gasp. A shiver. A whispered curse in Russian that I don't understand but definitely appreciate.

**"Dante,"** she breathes, and my name in her mouth sounds like a prayer and a threat all at once.

**"Tell me what you want,"** I say against her skin.

**"You. All of you. Now."**

I lift my head, meet her eyes.

**"Not yet."**

Her eyes flash with frustration and arousal in equal measure.

**"You're torturing me."**

**"I'm savoring you. There's a difference."**

My hand continues its exploration, finding places that make her breath catch, that make her pull against my grip on her wrists, that make her say my name in ways I've never heard anyone say it before.

**"Please,"** she says, and the word is so unexpected, so unlike her, that I nearly give in.

Nearly.

**"Say it again."**

**"Dante, please—"**

I release her wrists.

Immediately her hands are on me, pulling me closer, nails digging into my shoulders, my back, anywhere she can reach. Her mouth finds mine in a kiss that's all teeth and desperation and barely controlled violence.

The control I've been holding onto fractures.

Breaks.

Shatters completely.

---

### VIVIENNE

He loses control.

I feel the exact moment it happens. The shift from deliberate restraint to pure instinct, from calculated seduction to raw need.

And it's glorious.

His hands are everywhere, demanding and possessive, pulling me closer, tighter, like he can't get enough. Like I'm air and he's been drowning. His mouth follows, claiming skin, leaving marks, staking territory I didn't know I'd let anyone claim.

But I'm not passive.

I'm not surrendering completely.

I fight back.

Not to stop him. To match him.

I use the techniques I was taught—leverage, momentum, surprise. I hook my leg around his hip and flip us, reversing our positions in one smooth motion. Suddenly I'm on top, straddling him, hands braced on his chest, hair falling around us like a dark curtain.

He looks up at me, breathing hard, eyes dark and dangerous and absolutely delighted.

**"Trying to take control back?"** he asks.

**"Reminding you who you married,"** I reply.

He grins. Feral and beautiful.

**"Show me."**

So I do.

I lean down, capture his mouth in a bruising kiss while my hands explore freely. Every scar. Every muscle. Every place that makes him tense or groan or grab me harder.

I map his body the way a general maps enemy territory—cataloging weaknesses, pressure points, places to exploit.

A scar across his abdomen—old gunshot wound, poorly healed.

Another on his shoulder—knife, recent.

Bruises from earlier tonight, already darkening.

I press my thumb against the bullet graze on his shoulder—the fresh one from the cathedral—and he hisses, hands tightening on my hips.

**"Still hurt?"** I ask innocently.

**"Yes."**

I press harder.

**"Good."**

His eyes darken dangerously, and before I can react, he's moved. Fast. Controlled. One hand wraps around the back of my neck, pulling me down to him, while the other slides down my spine.

**"Two can play that game,"** he murmurs against my mouth.

**"I'm counting on it."**

I bite his lower lip hard enough to taste copper, and the groan that tears from his throat is the most satisfying sound I've ever heard.

We're both covered in blood still—his, mine, people we killed—and it should be grotesque. Should be wrong.

Instead it feels right.

Like we're baptizing each other in violence. Sealing something that started the moment our eyes met at that altar.

His hands slide up my thighs, grip my hips, and suddenly he's guiding me, setting rhythm and pace with an authority that should annoy me but instead sends heat spiraling through my core.

**"Vivienne,"** he growls, and the sound of my name in his voice—rough, desperate, barely controlled—undoes something inside me.

Something I didn't know could be undone.

I lean down, press my forehead to his, breathing the same air, feeling his heartbeat hammer against my palms where they're pressed to his chest.

**"I've never wanted anyone the way I want you,"** I admit, the truth slipping out before I can stop it.

His eyes lock onto mine, and for a moment, the psychopath, the killer, the heir to a criminal empire—all of it falls away.

What's left is just a man looking at a woman like she's the only real thing in his entire world.

**"Same,"** he says simply.

And then there are no more words.

---

### DANTE

Time fractures.

Stops meaning anything.

There's only sensation. Heat. Pressure. The slide of skin against skin—hers soft where mine is scarred, both of us damaged in different ways but fitting together perfectly anyway.

The sound of her breathing—ragged and wild and beautiful.

The way she says my name like it's the only word that matters.

The way her nails dig into my shoulders when I do something she likes, leaving marks I'll wear tomorrow with pride.

We move together—collision and convergence, control traded back and forth like a weapon neither of us wants to keep for long.

She bites my shoulder hard enough to bruise, and I return the favor, teeth finding the junction of her neck and shoulder, claiming skin that no one else will ever touch.

I leave fingerprints on her hips that will last for days.

She leaves scratches down my back that I'll feel every time I move.

We're destroying each other in the best possible way.

At some point she tries to slow down, tries to regain control, tries to pull back from whatever edge we're both racing toward. I don't let her.

I flip us again, pin her beneath me, and set a pace that's relentless, demanding, designed to strip away every layer of defense she has left.

**"Let go,"** I tell her.

**"I don't—I can't—"**

**"Yes, you can. Let go, Vivienne. I've got you."**

And something in those three words—*I've got you*—breaks through whatever wall she's been hiding behind.

Her entire body goes taut beneath me, trembling, on the edge of something she's never let herself fall into before.

**"Dante—"**

**"I've got you,"** I repeat. **"Let go."**

And she does.

I feel it the moment it happens. The way her entire body shatters, the way my name tears from her throat—raw and unguarded and absolutely perfect. The way she clings to me like I'm the only solid thing in a world that's dissolved around her.

And that—that sound, that moment, that trust—pulls me over the edge with her.

### VIVIENNE

The world goes white.

Then black.

Then slowly, gradually, comes back into focus.

I'm still breathing. Still alive. Still tangled with him in sheets that are thoroughly destroyed—torn in places, stained with blood and sweat and evidence of exactly what we just did.

My body aches in a dozen places. Good aches. Earned aches. Evidence of exactly how thoroughly we just wrecked each other.

Dante collapses beside me, breathing just as hard, and for a moment we just lie there, staring at the ceiling, trying to remember how language works.

My mind is still trying to process what just happened.

Not the physical act—I understand that. I've seduced men before. Used my body as a weapon, as a tool, as a means to an end.

This wasn't that.

This was something else entirely.

This was... real.

**"Fuck,"** Dante says eventually.

**"Yeah,"** I agree, because what else is there to say?

He turns his head to look at me, and despite everything we just did—despite the fact that he's seen every part of me, despite the intimacy we just shared—I feel heat rise in my cheeks under that gaze.

Why am I blushing now? After everything?

**"You okay?"** he asks, and there's genuine concern beneath the question.

Not tactical concern. Not strategic assessment.

Real concern.

For me.

When was the last time anyone asked me that and meant it?

**"More than okay,"** I tell him honestly. **"You?"**

**"Never better."**

He reaches out, pulls me against his chest, and I let him. Let myself be held. Let myself feel safe—actually safe, not tactically positioned or strategically placed—for the first time in longer than I can remember.

His fingers trace idle patterns on my shoulder, gentle now, all the violence temporarily burned away.

**"We should probably clean up,"** he says. **"We're both still covered in blood. Some of it isn't even ours."**

He's right. I can feel it—dried and flaking on my skin, mixed with sweat, a physical reminder of the cathedral massacre that feels like it happened years ago instead of hours.

**"In a minute,"** I murmur, not ready to move yet. Not ready to break this moment.

**"In a minute,"** he agrees, and his arms tighten around me slightly.

Silence settles between us. Comfortable. Strange. New.

I listen to his heartbeat. Strong. Steady. Alive.

We both could have died tonight. Multiple times. The attack was coordinated, professional. We survived through skill and luck and sheer bloody-minded refusal to die.

And now we're here.

Together.

Alive.

Then he speaks again, voice quiet, almost vulnerable.

**"I meant what I said earlier. I've never wanted anyone the way I want you."**

I lift my head to look at him properly.

**"Why me?"**

He's silent for a moment, thinking. Then:

**"Because you're the only person who's ever looked at me and seen exactly what I am—and smiled."**

My throat tightens unexpectedly.

**"You're the only person who's ever made me feel anything at all,"** I admit. **"Everyone else is just... static. Background noise. People going through motions I'm supposed to understand but don't. But you—"**

**"I'm loud,"** he finishes.

**"Deafening,"** I correct. **"In the best way. You make the world make sense. Or maybe you make it make less sense but in a way that finally feels honest."**

He kisses the top of my head, and the tenderness of it nearly breaks me.

**"We're fucked up,"** he says.

**"Completely,"** I agree.

**"Good. I wouldn't want it any other way."**

**"Neither would I."**

Another silence, this one heavier. Weighted with things we're both thinking but not saying.

Then I ask the question that's been hovering at the edge of my mind.

**"What happens now?"**

**"Now?"** He considers. **"Now we shower. Now we sleep. Tomorrow we deal with Marco Calabrese and the war he just started. Tomorrow we show both our families that this marriage is real. That we're a united front."**

**"And tonight?"**

**"Tonight we're just Dante and Vivienne. Not heirs. Not soldiers. Just... us."**

Just us.

I like the sound of that.

**"Okay,"** I say softly.

**"Okay."**

He doesn't move though. Neither do I.

**"Round two?"** he asks after a moment, and I can hear the smile in his voice.

I laugh—actually laugh, the sound surprising both of us.

**"You think you can keep up?"**

He shifts, suddenly looming over me again, eyes dark and hungry and absolutely focused.

**"Try me, wife."**

### DANTE

“**So,**” she says eventually, her voice rough, worn down to something honest. Her head rests against my chest like it belongs there. “**That was…**”

“**Insane?**”

She exhales, slow and satisfied. “**Perfect.**”

I run my fingers through her hair, the motion uncharacteristically gentle, the violence in me temporarily quieted. Not gone. Just sated. For now.

“**You’re terrifying,**” I tell her.

She doesn’t deny it. Just looks up at me and answers evenly, “**So are you.**”

A corner of my mouth lifts. “**We’re going to destroy each other.**”

She raises her head then, really looks at me, those sharp, merciless eyes cutting straight through whatever defenses I still pretend to have.

“**Probably,” she says, calm as a verdict. “But what a way to go.**”

I pull her closer without thinking, closer than strategy would advise, and press a kiss to her forehead.

The tenderness of it surprises me.

**"Welcome to the family, wife."**

**"Welcome to madness, husband."**

Outside, the sun is sinking toward the horizon, bleeding color across the sky. Blood still stains our skin, dried and tacky, a reminder of how the day began. Somewhere beyond these walls, enemies are regrouping. Schemes are forming. War is drawing breath.

None of it matters.

Not now.

Right now, there is only this moment. This room. This bed. Two monsters who met in the middle of a cathedral massacre and recognized themselves in each other without hesitation.

We didn’t negotiate it.
Didn’t question it.
Didn’t pretend it was anything else.

We chose each other.

Forever.

Or until one of us finally decides to put the other down.

Whichever comes first.

## CHAPTER 3: THE MORNING AFTER

### DANTE

Morning brings unexpected guests.

Not exactly unexpected. Just… unwanted. I thought mornings would still belong to just the two of us. I hoped too high.

I wake to the smell of coffee braided with gunpowder, rich and acrid, familiar and deeply wrong. The house feels awake in a way it shouldn't, too still, too alert, like it's holding its breath and waiting for orders. The space beside me in the bed is empty. Cold.

Apparently, we're not the kind of people who do morning cuddles.

Figures.

I follow the scent into the kitchen.

Vivienne is already there.

She's perched on the island in nothing but my shirt, bare legs hooked around the stool, completely unbothered by the world she's just thrown off balance. The fabric hangs loose on her, stolen and claimed, and her hair is a beautiful mess of dark intent, wild from sleep and sin. Somehow, she looks even more lethal like this. More beautiful. It should be illegal.

In her hands, her favorite knife glints as it catches the light. She cleans it slowly, lovingly, every motion precise and intimate, like a ritual she's performed a thousand times. Calm. Controlled. Tender in a way that has nothing to do with softness and everything to do with danger.

Calm.
Domestic.
Lethal.

God help me, I swallow hard, already picturing my hands on her again, lifting her, carrying her back to the bedroom we barely managed to leave last night.

She notices.

Of course she does.

She gestures casually toward the coffee and the small breakfast she's prepared, eggs still steaming, toast laid out with deceptive neatness. I barely register any of it. The room softens at the edges, everything else fading out of focus.

She speaks softly without looking up, never breaking the slow, deliberate rhythm of the blade in her hands, like she knows exactly what she's doing to me and has no intention of stopping.

**"We have a guest this morning, husband."**

She isn't alone.

My father, Lorenzo Morelli, sits at the table like he owns the day, espresso cradled in one hand. Across from him, Dmitri Rostov mirrors the posture, the same predator stillness, the same calculating patience. Two kings sharing caffeine and silence, watching. Measuring. Tracking every movement we make.

Their eyes flick to our necks. Then to my bare torso. I'm wearing nothing but boxers, having assumed the morning would be private, uncomplicated.

It isn't.

The evidence is impossible to miss. Scratches raked deep and unapologetic. Bite marks darkening skin. Bruises blooming where fingers dug in. Hickeys scattered across us like signatures, careless and intimate, marking territory without shame.

My father arches a brow.

**"Do I even want to ask?"** he says dryly, sarcasm sharpened into a blade.

Dmitri doesn't smile. He barely looks at either of us, clearly refusing to process the sight. **"Last night was… unexpected,"** he says stiffly. **"And now this. But we need to talk about Marco Calabrese's head. The one you left on his mother's doorstep at three in the morning. With a wedding bow."**

I blink.

Wait. What?

Vivienne's knife stills mid-stroke. Our eyes meet across the room, a single, silent exchange of certainty.

We didn't do that.
Neither of us left the house.

Vivienne laughs.

Then she says brightly, **"I can reassure you, Father, that there is absolutely no chance either of us did anything outside our bedroom last night,"** she says smoothly, a faint, wicked curve playing at her lips. **"We were… quite preoccupied."**

Her gaze slides to me as she says it, deliberate and unhurried, locking onto mine with intention. There's an invitation in her eyes, a slow pull back into memory, into heat and shadows and everything we did not bother to regret. Then she winks.

Just once.

So smooth, so perfectly timed, it catches me off guard and hits harder than it should. For a split second, the room blurs again, replaced by silk sheets and breathless sounds and the way her nails dug into my skin.

She knows exactly what she's doing.

And she enjoys every second of it.

My father chokes on his coffee.

Silence slams into the room, thick and stunned. He absolutely did not expect that level of blunt honesty from his new daughter-in-law. Vivienne, meanwhile, goes right back to what she was doing, calm, unbothered, not a hint of embarrassment in her posture. I catch a glimpse of something else in her expression.

Pride.

But the facts don't change.

Neither of us did it.

Which means only one thing.

Someone is framing us.

And worse, they're doing it loudly. Publicly. With flair.

Someone just declared war in our names.

**What do you do next?**
