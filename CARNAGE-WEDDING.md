## PROLOGUE: BEFORE THE VOWS

### **DANTE'S PERSPECTIVE**

I don’t believe in fate.

Fate is the word weak men reach for when the weight of their own decisions starts to crush them. A soft excuse. A comforting lie. Something to blame when the bill finally comes due. I don’t believe in destiny or cosmic plans or invisible hands guiding anything. I believe in blood. I believe in leverage. I believe in the precise gravity of a name spoken in the right room at the right moment, and in the way that room goes silent afterward.

My name is Dante Morelli.

If you’ve heard it before, then you already understand why people hesitate when they say it. You already know enough to be afraid.

I was born into violence the way other children are born into comfort. It wasn’t a deviation. It was the default. Violence was my inheritance, my education, my first language. The Morelli family has ruled New York’s underworld for three generations, and I am what comes next. Not the eldest son. That was Antonio, until two bullets ended his claim on a sidewalk outside a Queens restaurant. Not the sharpest mind. That’s Lucia, who turns blood money into clean ledgers and balanced books.

But I am the most dangerous.

I am the one they send when conversation collapses. When deals rot. When mercy is no longer part of the equation. When the message has to be delivered in a way that can’t be misunderstood.

I am beautiful.

I say it the way one acknowledges an undeniable truth, stripped of vanity or hesitation. The way you register the sharpness of a blade before it cuts, or the color of the sky just before a storm breaks. My eyes are blue, pale and cold, the kind that never look away first. My hair is red, catching the light like a warning flare, impossible to unsee once it’s burned into your vision. A face that makes women misplace their caution and men quietly question their own worth.

I have never pursued attention.

It follows me instead, instinctively. The way blood unfurls through water. Slow. Inevitable. Hungry.

And yes, I use it.

Beauty is just another weapon. It opens doors that should stay closed. It lowers defenses people swear they’ll keep up. It convinces them the damage I’m capable of must be exaggerated, theatrical, someone else’s reputation mistaken for mine. By the time they realize otherwise, running is no longer an option. I’ve cut throats while women whispered my name like a secret. I’ve burned enemies alive while their friends stared at my face instead of reaching for their guns. Prettiness. Cruelty. Control. I learned early how to sharpen all three until they were indistinguishable.

My father is dying.

Lung cancer.

Six months, maybe less, according to men who lower their voices and refuse to meet my eyes, as if death might jump from him to them if they’re careless enough. His body is rotting from the inside out, drowning slowly in its own decay, and he knows it. He feels the clock in his chest every time he coughs. Every time blood rises where air should be.

So he has spent the last year doing what dying kings always do.

Strangling uncertainty.

Every loose end has been pulled tight enough to cut. Every potential rival weighed, neutralized, or marked for elimination. Power has been stacked where no one can reach it, layered with threats and favors and blood debts, all designed to survive him. He is building a future that won’t hesitate to devour itself the moment he’s lowered into the ground.

Because succession is never peaceful.

It is a carcass thrown into a pit, and whoever claws their way out alive gets to rule what’s left.

Part of his solution is ending a war that has been feeding on us for nearly a decade. A slow hemorrhage of bodies and money and influence. A conflict that has already taken more than it ever gave back.

He doesn’t want peace.

He wants control that will outlive his corpse.

The Bratva.
The Russian mob.
And, more precisely, the Rostov family.

Viktor Rostov is vicious in the ancient sense of the word. Not impulsive. Not theatrical. The kind of man who learned early that power is built by standing on bodies and never acknowledging the sound they make when they stop breathing. He didn’t climb so much as carve his way upward, leaving a trail of broken men and unfinished graves behind him. Fear is his native language. Death, his punctuation. Anyone who ever stood in his path learned the same lesson: they were temporary. Expendable. Already dead, whether they knew it yet or not.

For years, our families have existed in a state of mutual slaughter. Not chaos. Not rage. Precision. Soldier for soldier. Name for name. A clean, methodical exchange of corpses. An economy of violence that feeds no one and poisons everything it touches. Each retaliation demands another. Each victory rots into weakness. We’ve been bleeding slowly, deliberately, like animals too proud to step away from the trap.

My father, pragmatic down to the bone, finally decided the math no longer worked.

He didn’t mourn the dead. He didn’t rage at the injustice of it all. He simply recognized that the cycle would eventually consume us both, leaving nothing worth inheriting.

So he chose a cleaner solution.

A treaty.

Not written in ink. Written in flesh.

Sealed with a marriage.

His son. Rostov’s daughter.

Me. And her.

I heard her name once.

Vivienne Rostova. Twenty-six. Trained. Dangerous in the way Bratva daughters are taught to be dangerous. Not wild, not reckless, but engineered. Educated in violence the way other women are educated in etiquette. Raised to be useful. Raised to be leverage. Raised with the unspoken understanding that if her value ever diminished, she would be discarded without ceremony.

I was handed a photograph.

Dark hair. Pale skin. High cheekbones. A face composed with deliberate symmetry. Beautiful, in the clinical sense. The kind of beauty that photographs well and bleeds just as easily as anything else.

Beauty means very little in my world.

It’s the most abundant currency there is.

I didn’t ask questions.

I didn’t argue.

This was never meant to be a romance.

It was business. A merger. A calculated binding of two families that would otherwise continue bleeding each other into extinction. A solution born of arithmetic, not sentiment. She would be my wife on paper only, a carefully placed symbol of peace meant to quiet guns and postpone graves.

I would give her a title. A house. A bed she would learn to leave untouched and cold.

In return, I expected silence.

Obedience.

Nothing more.

I expected weakness.

A woman shaped by violence and emptied by it. Someone who learned to survive by complying, by making herself smaller, by folding quietly beneath the will of men who decided her fate without ever asking. Someone who would meet my gaze with fear. Or bitterness. Or that slow, bloodless resignation that kills a person long before the body follows. Someone who would fade into irrelevance the moment the ink dried on the contract.

I expected someone forgettable.

I am, as it turns out, completely wrong.

I just don’t know it yet.

Three hours before my wedding, I’m standing in a warehouse in Brooklyn, executing a man who forgot where his loyalty was supposed to live.

His name is irrelevant. Names lose their value the moment betrayal enters the equation. What matters is the mistake. The choice. The arrogance of thinking consequences can be outsourced.

He sold information to the Calabrese family, convinced himself they could bury him deep enough that my reach would stop at the state line. It didn’t. We tore him out of a safe house in Jersey, bound him while he screamed, let him bleed just enough to stay conscious, and brought him back to the city. Back to where he belonged.

Now he’s on his knees on cold concrete, soaked in his own blood. His hands won’t stop shaking. His eyes are wide with the late, useless understanding that every bad decision is patient, and that it always comes to collect.

“**Please,**” he chokes, voice collapsing in on itself. “**Please, Dante. I have a family. I have—**”

I don’t let him finish.

The bullet enters cleanly between his eyes. No hesitation. No ceremony. The sound snaps through the empty warehouse and hangs there, sharp and final, like the last word in a conversation that ended long before he realized it. His body folds forward, lifeless, as if someone simply turned him off.

One of my men steps forward and drags the corpse away, leaving a dark smear across the floor where he stopped being a problem.

I glance at my watch.

Two hours and forty minutes until the wedding.

I’m still wearing the suit I’ll stand at the altar in. Custom-tailored. Charcoal gray. Italian silk. It was immaculate once. Now it’s flecked with blood, some of it still wet, catching the light when I move, darkening the fabric like a quiet confession. Evidence that hasn’t had time to dry.

I consider changing.

The thought doesn’t survive long enough to matter.

No.

Let her see it. Let her take it in without explanation or apology. Let her understand, immediately and without room for misunderstanding, exactly what she’s agreeing to. Who she’s binding herself to. What kind of man arrives at his own wedding carrying death with him like an accessory.

I want no illusions between us. No softened edges. No polite lies.

I don’t believe in pretense.

If this marriage is going to be a lie, then it will be an honest one—stripped of illusion, soaked in truth, and paid for in blood. No masks. No gentle fiction. Just exactly what we are, standing in full view, daring the world to look away.

### **VIVIENNE'S PERSPECTIVE**

I’ve been dead inside since I was twelve years old.

Not metaphorically. Not poetically. Dead in the clinical sense. Neurologically. The parts of me where empathy, fear, and guilt are supposed to live simply… don’t. I know this because I’ve been tested. Evaluated. Observed under cold lights by men in white coats who asked their careful questions while my brain flickered across monitors. They watched. They measured. And they concluded, with varying degrees of professional distance, that I am a psychopath.

They’re right.

I don’t feel the way other people do. I don’t bond. I don’t attach. I don’t lie awake drowning in regret or shame or yearning for things I’ve lost. I experience the world as a sequence of transactions. Strategic exchanges. Variables to be solved or removed. When emotions surface, they are thin and temporary. Curiosity. Irritation. Boredom. Nothing with roots. Nothing that stays.

My father made me this way.

Viktor Rostov has never been a sentimental man. When I was born, he saw an asset, not a daughter. When my mother died of cancer—when I was six—he saw opportunity. No softness left to interfere. No one to object. He shaped me the way a man shapes a weapon meant to last. Languages. Combat. Seduction. Marksmanship. Poisons. Interrogation. Control. Precision. Obedience to outcome, not morality.

By the time I was twelve, I killed my first target.

A low-level rival skimming money from one of my father’s operations. Insignificant in the larger scheme. Disposable. Necessary.

I remember placing the gun against his head.

I remember pulling the trigger.

I remember feeling nothing.

And I remember my father’s approval, sharp and unmistakable.

**“Good,”** he said. **“No hesitation. That’s my girl.”**

Since then, I’ve killed one hundred and forty-seven people.

I stopped counting after that. Not because of guilt. Guilt never entered the equation. The number simply stopped being interesting. Some deaths were quick. Bullets. Clean. Efficient. Others were slower. Blades. Garrotes. Pain measured carefully when information had to come first. I was good at it. Exceptional. The best, my father would say, though praise from him was rare and always earned in blood.

In certain circles, I became known as Viper.

I didn’t choose the name. I didn’t reject it either. It fit too well.

And then, gradually, inevitably, boredom set in.

Killing lost its edge.

What was once electric and intimate became routine. Procedural. Mechanical. Pull the trigger. Wipe the blade. Move on. There was no challenge left. No risk. No one who could match me, surprise me, or push hard enough to make something stir inside my chest. Nothing that felt even remotely like excitement.

Just emptiness.

And time stretching endlessly in front of me, waiting for something—anything—to finally break the monotony.

I am twenty-six years old, and I am exhausted by my own existence.

Not tired in the way people mean when they complain about long days or sleepless nights. This is deeper than fatigue. It’s the weariness of repetition. Of knowing exactly how every situation will end before it begins. Of moving through life untouched by it, unstimulated, unchanged.

Then my father tells me I’m getting married.

He doesn’t ask. He informs.

An arranged marriage, designed to cauterize a war that’s been bleeding both families dry for years. Dante Morelli. Heir to the Italian mob. A man I’ve never met, but whose reputation travels faster than his shadow. Brutal. Sadistic. Unstable when it serves him, precise when it doesn’t. A killer, like me. A psychopath, most likely, though I doubt anyone ever bothered to diagnose him.

They give me a dossier.

Photographs. Intelligence reports. Behavioral profiles.

He’s beautiful.

Pale blue eyes. Red hair. A face that could belong in a museum or a nightmare, depending on where you’re standing. But beauty doesn’t impress me. Beauty is tactical. It’s leverage. It’s camouflage. It’s a tool, and I understand its mechanics better than most. What holds my attention is the violence threaded through his record. The bodies left behind. The efficiency. The whispers about his appetite for cruelty when restraint no longer serves a purpose.

Most women, I imagine, would be terrified.

I’m intrigued.

Not because I expect kindness. Not because I’m foolish enough to romanticize what this is. This isn’t love, and it isn’t partnership. It’s curiosity. Sharp and unfamiliar. The kind I haven’t felt in years. I wonder if he’s truly as dangerous as they claim. I wonder if he’ll bore me the way everyone else eventually does. I wonder if he’ll fracture when I test him—and I will test him—or if he’ll push back hard enough to make things interesting.

I agree without protest.

My father is visibly surprised. He’d anticipated resistance. Negotiation. Perhaps even defiance. Instead, I nod once and ask when the wedding is.

“**Two weeks,**” he says.

**“Fine.”**

He watches me for a long moment, searching for something he’s never managed to find. Fear. Resentment. Doubt. Anything recognizably human. He comes up empty, as always.

“**You understand what this means,**” he says carefully. “**You’ll belong to him. To the Morelli family. You’ll be expected to—**”

**“I understand,”** I cut in. **“I’ll play the role.”**

I always do.

And then the day of the wedding arrives.

I’m dressed in white.

The gown is custom-made, elegant, traditional down to every deliberate stitch. It fits perfectly, which only makes it feel more like a costume. That’s appropriate. This is theater. A performance staged for power and appearances. I’ll stand at an altar, recite vows that mean nothing, and legally bind myself to a man I’ve never met.

And then I’ll see what he’s made of.

The ceremony takes place in a cathedral in Manhattan. Neutral ground. Sacred stone temporarily borrowed by men who kill for a living. Both families are present, along with their respective entourages, an uneasy peace maintained by mutual self-interest and loaded guns beneath tailored jackets. I take my place at the altar and wait.

He’s late.

Ten minutes.
Fifteen.
Twenty.

A low murmur spreads through the pews like a nervous infection. My father’s jaw tightens, the muscle ticking beneath his skin. The priest shifts his weight, sweat gathering at his collar. I remain perfectly still, unbothered. Lateness is information. Either a delay beyond his control or a deliberate assertion of power. Both are instructive.

Then the doors open.

Dante Morelli steps inside.

He’s wearing a charcoal-gray suit, immaculately tailored, the kind of craftsmanship that announces money before he ever speaks.

It’s covered in blood.

Fresh. Still darkening the fabric in places. Flecked across his chest and sleeves. A careless smear along his jaw, as if violence followed him here and he couldn’t be bothered to wash it off. He walks down the aisle without haste, without apology, pale blue eyes sweeping the cathedral with the calm confidence of a man who already owns the room.

Everything stops.

My father’s men tense, hands drifting just a little closer to concealed weapons. The Morelli soldiers remain motionless, unreadable. The priest looks like he might be sick.

And I smile.

Not politely.
Not nervously.

A real smile.

Because for the first time in a very, very long time, something sharp and electric sparks to life inside me.

Interest.

He reaches the altar and stops in front of me. Our eyes lock, and for a suspended moment, neither of us speaks. He studies me the way I study him. Measuring. Weighing. Calculating risk and reward.

“**You’re late,**” I say, my voice calm.

**“Needed to take care of something.”** he replies.

**“I can see that.”**

The corner of his mouth lifts, not quite a smile. “**Does it bother you?**”

**“No.”**

**“Good.”**

The priest clears his throat, eager to move forward before this becomes something else entirely.

**“Shall we begin?”** he asks, his voice thin.

Dante doesn’t look away from me.

**“Let’s.”**

---

### **THE UNSPOKEN TRUTH**

What neither of us says, standing at the altar beneath vaulted stone and watching eyes, beneath God and the brittle treaty stitching our families together, is this:

We recognize each other.

Not romantically. Not in the childish sense of fate or soulmates or stars aligning just so. There is nothing poetic about it.

It’s instinct.

The way predators identify their own across a distance. The way something old and precise wakes up and pays attention.

He sees the emptiness in me immediately. The absence behind the smile. The cold arithmetic running beneath my calm. He understands, without needing it explained, that what looks like composure is simply lack of fear.

I see the chaos in him. The violence coiled so tightly it looks like control. He wears it naturally, like a second skin, like something that has never known how to be removed.

Most people would recoil from this realization.

Most people would feel the warning and step back.

We lean in.

This marriage was meant to be a strategy. A merger. A calculated move to stop the bleeding before it destroyed us all.

It isn’t going to be that.

It’s going to be far worse.

And far, far better.

---

## THE WORLD

**Setting:** New York City, present day  
**Power Structure:**
- **Morelli Family (Italian Mob):** Controls trafficking, loan sharking, protection rackets, legitimate businesses (restaurants, construction)
- **Rostov Bratva (Russian Mob):** Controls arms dealing, human trafficking, cybercrime, money laundering

**The War:** The two families have been killing each other for a decade over territorial disputes. Both are weakened. Both are bleeding resources. The marriage is a truce, but truces in this world are fragile things, held together by self-interest and the threat of mutually assured destruction.

**The Stakes:** If the marriage fails, the war resumes. If either family shows weakness, rival factions (Calabrese, Yakuza, Triads) will move in. Both Dante and Vivienne understand this. Neither particularly cares. They're more interested in each other.

---

## THEMES

- **Violence as intimacy:** For Dante and Vivienne, violence isn't just a tool—it's a language, a form of connection
- **Toxicity as compatibility:** They're not good for each other. They're perfect for each other. There's a difference.
- **Power dynamics:** Constant struggle for control, neither willing to submit, both thriving in the push-and-pull
- **The void:** What happens when two people incapable of love find the only person who understands that emptiness?

---

## TONE & STYLE

**Narrative Voice:** Second person (You are Dante) for immersion and complicity  
**Prose Style:** Sharp, visceral, unflinching. No romanticizing the violence. No apologizing for the characters.  
**Pacing:** Slow burn tension punctuated by explosive moments (literal and metaphorical)  
**Content Warnings:** Extreme violence, murder, morally bankrupt protagonists, toxic relationship dynamics, sexual content, psychological manipulation

---

## NOW WE BEGIN

The priest finishes the vows.

There’s a pause. The kind heavy with expectation. Tradition dictates the next move.

You’re supposed to kiss your bride.

Vivienne looks up at you, waiting. There’s no tremor in her gaze. No nerves. No soft anticipation. Just cool, clinical curiosity, sharp enough to cut. She’s watching you the way she’d watch a weapon being drawn. Interested in how you’ll use it.

You step closer.

The blood on your suit smears against the white of her gown, a dark, intimate stain blooming where it shouldn’t. A desecration, some would call it.

She doesn’t flinch.

You lift a hand and cup her face. Your knuckles are still bruised, skin split and tender from earlier. From breaking a man open piece by piece until the truth spilled out, and then ending him. The marks are fresh. Honest.

Her skin beneath your palm is cold.

You kiss her.

It isn’t gentle.
It isn’t reverent.
It isn’t romantic.

It’s a claim.

A challenge issued mouth to mouth. Pressure and intent and the unmistakable promise of violence wrapped in intimacy. You take, not ask. You test, not soothe.

When you pull back, she’s smiling.

Not shaken.
Not offended.
Not surprised.

**“Hello, husband,”** she says, voice smooth, almost amused.

**“Hello, wife.”**

The crowd applauds, hesitant at first, then louder. Relief ripples through them. No shots fired. No blood spilled at the altar. A successful ceremony, by their standards.

You don’t let go of her face.

You lean in just enough that only she can hear you.

**“Are you going to be trouble?”** you ask.

Her smile widens, slow and deliberate, eyes gleaming with something dark and delighted.

**“I’m going to be the best trouble you’ve ever had.”**

---

You don't let go of her face.

If anything, your grip tightens. Not enough to hurt her. Never that. Just enough to anchor her there, to make sure she feels you. To make sure she understands this moment is real, that it belongs to both of you. Your thumb drags along the sharp line of her jaw, slow, deliberate, unmistakably possessive.

**"Prove it,"** you murmur, your voice pitched low, meant for her alone.

Her eyes don't widen. They don't soften. They ignite.

Not fear.
Interest.

**"Somewhere private,"** she says smoothly. **"I want to see if you bleed as pretty as you smile."**

She steps closer, presses herself against you harder, deliberately invading your space, daring you to react. She's about to say something else when it happens.

A sound that does not belong in a cathedral.

Glass explodes.

Not cracks. Not trembles. It detonates, stained-glass saints obliterated in an instant, colored shards raining down across marble and silk. Screams tear through the air, sharp and frantic, immediately drowned out by the clean, brutal crack of gunfire echoing through stone and vaulted ceilings.

Someone is shooting up your wedding.

Instinct moves before thought can catch up. You act fast, ruthless, exact. You shove Vivienne down and cover her with your body as bullets rip through what remains of the windows, turning holy icons into glittering wreckage. Chaos erupts. Your men draw weapons. Her father's soldiers return fire. Guests scatter, slipping on polished marble, diving beneath pews like prey animals fleeing a slaughter.

But Vivienne doesn't cower beneath you.

She laughs.

You feel it first, a subtle vibration against your chest. Dark. Delighted. Genuine joy, untouched by the violence tearing the room apart.

**"This is perfect,"** she says, bright and almost giddy, her voice edged with something beautifully unhinged.

A blade flashes.

She produces a knife from somewhere inside her wedding dress. You didn't see it. Didn't sense it. Didn't even consider that she might be armed. She tilts her head up toward you, and for the first time since you met her, her eyes are fully awake. Sharp. Alive. Hungry.

**"So,"** she says lightly, over gunfire and screams, **"do we kill them together, or do we make this a competition?"**

Three realizations hit you all at once.

Your wedding is under attack, likely Calabrese, aiming to erase both heirs in a single, efficient massacre.
Your wife is armed, dangerous, and savoring every second of it.
And somewhere between shattered glass and blood-slick marble, you realize you might actually be in love.

**"Competition,"** you decide.

Your voice is calm. Certain.

**"Whoever kills more buys drinks tonight."**

Her grin turns feral. Beautiful. A promise written in blood.

**"You're on, husband."**

---

## CHAPTER 1: THE BLOOD WEDDING

### DANTE

You roll off her and move.

No hesitation. No wasted motion. Just pure, efficient violence.

Your gun is already in your hand—Beretta M9, custom grip, fifteen rounds—pulled from the shoulder holster beneath your blood-stained jacket. You don't remember drawing it. Muscle memory. Instinct older than thought.

A gunman bursts through the side entrance, tactical gear, ski mask, AR-15 raised. Calabrese colors on his vest. Sloppy. Arrogant. He thinks he's walking into a massacre.

He's right.

Just not his.

You put two rounds center mass before he clears the doorway. He drops, choking on his own blood, weapon clattering across marble. 

**One.**

You don't stop moving.

The cathedral has become a warzone. Your soldiers and the Bratva forces have taken defensive positions, returning fire at the attackers pouring in from multiple entrances. Guests are screaming, crawling, dying. You don't care about them. Collateral damage. Background noise.

What you care about is the body count.

And your wife.

You glance back.

Vivienne is already moving, low and fast, white dress dragging through broken glass and pooling blood. She doesn't run for cover. She runs *toward* the fight.

A gunman rounds the corner near the altar, weapon sweeping for targets.

He never sees her coming.

She closes the distance impossibly fast, a blur of white silk and dark intent. Her knife—thin, professional, probably Russian military issue—flashes once. Twice. Three times. Throat. Kidney. Femoral artery. Precision cuts, each one fatal, executed in less than two seconds.

The man collapses, gurgling, drowning in arterial spray.

She doesn't even look down at him.

**"One,"** she calls out, voice bright, almost singing it.

You can't help it.

You smile.

She nearly trips.

The dress is wrong for this. Too much fabric, too much weight, silk catching where it shouldn't, slowing her by half a second. Half a second is enough in a gunfight.

You see it instantly.

You grab her and pull her in, fast and hard, intending to shield her, to move her out of the line of fire but momentum betrays you. She slams into your chest, closer than planned, closer than smart. Way too close.

Her lips stop inches from yours.

Not a kiss. Not quite. Just breath and heat and chaos.

Both of you are breathing hard. Gunfire cracks behind you. Marble chips explode at your feet. Somewhere, someone screams. But right here, for a suspended, impossible second, the world narrows to the space between your mouths.

You brush her by accident. A bare graze. Enough to be felt. Enough to be noticed.

Her eyes lock onto yours.

No fear. No hesitation.

Recognition.

The kind that hits like impact, sharp and electric, like you've both just realized you're standing in the same storm and neither of you plans to step back.

**"Dress,"** you mutter, low, almost a growl.

Before she can answer, you move.

You take the knife from her hand in one smooth motion, fingers closing around the grip as you pivot behind her, body pressed to her back for a split second longer than necessary. She doesn't resist. Doesn't protest. Trusts you without asking why.

You spin her, fast and controlled, and slash.

Fabric gives way under the blade. Silk tears open with a vicious sound, the skirt of her wedding gown splitting clean, freeing her legs, stripping the dress of its restraint. Another cut. Then another. Practical. Precise. No wasted motion.

She inhales sharply, not from fear.

From thrill.

You step back just enough to finish, eyes never leaving hers as you flick the blade, testing its balance once.

Then you press the knife back into her palm.

Handle first.

Her fingers close around it instantly, like it never left her, like this is exactly where it belongs.

She smiles at you then.

Not sweet. Not soft.

Dangerously intimate.

**"About time,"** she says, rolling her shoulders, newly free, blood and silk brushing the marble. **"Now I can move."**

Gunfire erupts again, closer this time.

You lean in, just enough for her to hear you over the chaos.

**"Try not to slow me down,"** you murmur.

Her eyes burn.

**"Don't worry,"** she replies. **"I'll make it hard for you to keep up."**

Then she turns, dress ruined, knife gleaming, and dives straight back into the violence like it's a dance she was born knowing.

Another attacker appears on your left, firing wild, panicked. Amateur. You sidestep, let the bullets pass where you were standing a heartbeat ago, and return fire. Single shot. Headshot. Brain matter decorates the stained glass behind him.

**Two.**

A third comes from the right. You pivot, fire twice. Chest. Throat. He goes down hard, weapon skittering away.

**Three.**

Movement in your peripheral vision.

Vivienne has engaged two attackers simultaneously. One tries to grab her—stupid, suicidal—and she lets him. Uses his momentum against him, spins inside his guard, and drives her blade up under his ribs, angling toward his heart. Textbook kill. He gasps, eyes wide, and she holds him there for a moment, watching the light fade.

Then she shoves him away and turns on the second attacker.

He raises his gun.

She's faster.

She throws her knife.

It embeds in his eye socket with a wet, meaty sound, punching through to his brain. He drops instantly, dead before he hits the ground.

**"Three,"** she announces, walking calmly to retrieve her blade, pulling it free with a wet *schlik* that echoes despite the gunfire.

You're losing.

Unacceptable.

You spot a cluster of three gunmen advancing down the center aisle, firing in controlled bursts, professional, coordinated. Calabrese elite. Trained. Dangerous.

Not dangerous enough.

You break from cover, sprinting directly at them.

They see you coming. Adjust aim. Fire.

You're already moving, serpentine pattern, making yourself an impossible target. Bullets crack past your head, close enough to feel the displaced air. One grazes your shoulder, tearing fabric, drawing blood.

You don't slow down.

At ten feet, you slide, marble slick with blood, dropping beneath their line of fire. You come up between them, inside their guard, too close for their rifles to track effectively.

Gun to the first one's temple. Fire.

**Four.**

Spin. Elbow strike to the second's throat, crushing his windpipe. He drops, choking, dying slow.

**Five.**

The third tries to swing his rifle like a club. You catch it, redirect the momentum, and use it to pull him off balance. Your gun comes up under his chin. Fire.

**Six.**

The body crumples.

You look up.

Vivienne is standing on top of a pew, elevated, surveying the chaos like a queen surveying her kingdom. Her white dress is soaked red now, impossible to tell how much is hers and how much belongs to others. Probably none of it is hers.

An attacker tries to flank her from behind.

She doesn't turn around.

She just steps backward off the pew, letting gravity do the work, and drops onto him. Her weight drives him down, and her knife is already moving. She stabs him repeatedly—face, neck, chest—each strike precise, clinical, overkill in the most literal sense.

When she stands, she's smiling.

**"Six,"** she says, meeting your eyes across the cathedral.

Tied.

**"Not for long,"** you reply.

The main doors explode inward—not kicked, not shot, literally blown apart with breaching charges. Smoke and splinters fill the air. More gunmen pour through, at least a dozen, heavily armed, organized.

This was planned. Coordinated. A full-scale assassination attempt.

They didn't account for one thing.

Neither of you wants to leave.

You want to *play.*

You reload without looking, muscle memory, mag out, fresh mag in, chamber a round. Fourteen bullets. Fourteen more kills, if you're efficient.

Vivienne has retrieved a second knife from somewhere—maybe off one of the bodies, maybe she had two all along—and she's dual-wielding now, blades reversed, edges out. Combat stance. Feral grace.

She looks at you.

You look at her.

No words needed.

You both move at the same time.

The gunmen spread out, trying to establish crossfire, trying to corner you both. They're thinking tactically, professionally. They're treating this like a military operation.

Mistake.

This isn't war.

This is hunting season.

You take the left flank. Six targets. You move through them like a scalpel through flesh. Shoot, move, shoot, move. No wasted shots. No hesitation. Each kill is efficient, necessary, beautiful in its simplicity.

Headshot. **Seven.**
Double-tap center mass. **Eight.**
Kneecap, then execution shot when he falls. **Nine.**

Behind you, Vivienne is dancing.

There's no other word for it. She flows between attackers like water, blades flashing, always moving, never where they expect. She cuts tendons, severs arteries, destroys joints. Not killing immediately, but ensuring death comes soon, inevitably, painfully.

A man screams as she opens his stomach, his insides spilling onto sacred ground.

**"Seven,"** she counts.

Another drops, throat opened, choking on blood.

**"Eight."**

You catch movement in the choir loft—sniper, trying to get a high angle. Smart. Dangerous.

You fire three shots upward. The first two miss. The third catches him in the shoulder, spinning him around. He falls from the loft, twenty feet down, lands hard. Bones crack audibly.

You walk over. Put a round in his skull.

**Ten.**

A gunman tries to surrender, dropping his weapon, raising his hands.

**"Wait, wait, please—"**

Vivienne doesn't wait.

She's on him before he finishes the sentence, knife buried in his throat. She holds him there, watching his eyes as he dies, studying him like a specimen.

**"Nine,"** she whispers.

You're still ahead.

The remaining attackers are retreating now, realizing this isn't going according to plan, that the targets are hunting *them.* They fall back toward the exits, firing wildly, desperately.

You let them run.

Then you shoot them in the back.

**Eleven. Twelve.**

Vivienne throws one of her knives. It spins end over end, perfect rotation, and embeds between a fleeing attacker's shoulder blades. He stumbles, falls, doesn't get back up.

**"Ten,"** she says.

One gunman left.

He's trapped behind an overturned pew, pinned down by covering fire from your men. Terrified. Alone. Out of options.

You and Vivienne see him at the same time.

Your eyes meet.

She raises an eyebrow.

You shrug.

**"Together?"** you offer.

**"Together,"** she agrees.

You approach from opposite sides, flanking him, giving him nowhere to run. He sees you both coming, raises his gun, swings it back and forth, unsure who to aim at.

**"Please,"** he begs. **"Please, I was just following orders, I didn't—"**

You shoot him in the right kneecap.

He screams, collapses.

Vivienne stabs him in the left shoulder, pinning him to the floor.

He screams louder.

You crouch down next to him, grab his face, force him to look at you.

**"Who sent you?"** you ask calmly.

**"C-Calabrese,"** he chokes out. **"Marco Calabrese. He wanted both families gone. He—"**

**"Thank you,"** you say.

Then you shoot him between the eyes.

Silence.

The gunfire stops. The screams fade. The cathedral settles into an eerie, blood-soaked quiet. Bodies everywhere. Dozens of them. Attackers. Guests. Collateral.

Your men are securing the perimeter. The Bratva soldiers are checking the dead. Your father is alive, sheltered behind his bodyguards. Viktor Rostov likewise.

The treaty holds.

Barely.

You stand, holster your weapon, and turn to Vivienne.

She's covered in blood head to toe. Her white dress is ruined, drenched crimson, torn in places, clinging to her like a second skin. Her hair is wild, coming loose from whatever style it was in. She has blood on her face, speckled across her cheek like war paint.

She's never looked more beautiful.

**"Final count?"** she asks.

You calculate. **"Twelve. You?"**

**"Ten,"** she admits, sounding almost annoyed.

You grin. **"You owe me drinks."**

She steps closer, close enough to touch, close enough that you can smell the copper-tang of blood mixing with her perfume.

**"Best two out of three?"** she offers.

**"There's going to be a next time?"**

Her smile is slow, predatory, full of dark promise.

**"Husband, with enemies like ours, there's always going to be a next time."**

She's right.

Marco Calabrese just declared war on both families. This was his opening move. There will be retaliation. Escalation. More violence. More bodies.

Most people would be terrified.

You're excited.

And so is she.

You reach out, cup her blood-slick face, and kiss her.

It's nothing like the kiss at the altar.

This one is real.

Raw. Hungry. Teeth and tongue and the taste of gunpowder and death. She kisses you back just as hard, fisting her hands in your ruined jacket, pulling you closer, claiming you the way you claimed her.

When you finally break apart, both breathing hard, she laughs.

**"So,"** she says, **"about that honeymoon..."**

---

I can't get enough of that kiss.

I know she feels it too. I see it in the way her breath hasn't settled, in the way her gaze keeps finding my mouth like it belongs there. For the first time, something unfamiliar coils low in my chest.

Hunger.

Not the old kind. Not power. Not money. Not blood or territory or legacy.

Her.

It hits harder than anything that's ever driven me. Sharper. More dangerous. A craving that doesn't want to conquer, only to claim. To keep.

I'm dimly aware of the room again. Of eyes on us. Both families watching, measuring, counting breaths, making sure their prized heirs are still standing. Guns lowered, fingers tense, violence paused on a knife's edge.

They're worried about survival.

We're distracted by something else entirely.

By each other.

It's almost absurd how little anything else matters.

Without asking, without explaining, I slip an arm beneath her knees and lift her, bridal-style. The motion is instinctive, possessive, final. She doesn't protest. Doesn't tense. Her arm slides around my neck like this is where she was always meant to be.

The room parts as I start walking.

I don't look at anyone. Not my men. Not her father. Not the bodies, the blood, the shattered glass underfoot. None of it registers. The world narrows again, this time to the weight of her in my arms, the heat of her body, the way her fingers curl slightly into my shoulder like she's anchoring herself there.

Or anchoring me.

We move through the wreckage like the destruction was staged for us, like the blood and broken glass are nothing more than decoration. Chaos bends out of our way. People freeze, watching, knowing better than to interfere. Whatever rules still exist in this room do not apply to us anymore.

She shifts in my arms, slow and intentional. Not to get comfortable. To make sure I feel her. Her thigh presses closer. Her fingers tighten at the back of my neck, nails grazing skin just enough to warn me.

Her head tilts. Her mouth drifts to my ear, not touching, not yet. Heat radiates from her like a promise she has no intention of keeping gentle.

“**Where are we going?**” she asks, voice low, intimate, dangerous.

My jaw tightens. My grip adjusts, firmer now, unmistakably claiming. I lean just enough that my breath brushes her ear when I answer.

“**Somewhere private,**” I say. “**Somewhere no one will interrupt what happens next.**”

Her laugh slips out, soft and dark, satisfaction threaded through it. The sound sinks straight into my bloodstream.

“**Good**,” she murmurs.

I don’t slow.

I don’t hesitate.

I walk past bodies, past guns, past men who would die for us without understanding why. The only thing that matters is the weight of her in my arms, the tension coiled between us, the certainty that once we’re alone, restraint is no longer part of the equation.

Whatever just ignited between us doesn’t want witnesses.

It wants consequences.

## CHAPTER 2: THE HONEYMOON

### DANTE

The car is waiting outside. Black Mercedes S-Class, bulletproof, windows tinted so dark you can't see inside even in daylight. My driver opens the door without a word, trained not to ask questions, trained not to see things he shouldn't.

I slide into the backseat with Vivienne still in my arms, door slamming shut behind us.

Privacy. Finally.

The partition between us and the driver is already up. Soundproof. We could scream and he wouldn't hear a thing.

I set her down on the leather seat, but I don't move away. Can't. My hand stays on her waist, fingers pressing into ruined silk and the warm skin beneath.

She looks at me, eyes bright, dangerous, fully alive.

**"So,"** she says. **"Twelve to ten. You won."**

**"I did."**

**"What do you want as your prize?"**

I lean in, close enough that my lips brush her ear.

**"Everything,"** I whisper.

Her breath catches. Just barely. But I hear it.

The car starts moving, pulling away from the cathedral, from the bodies, from the witnesses. Heading toward my estate on the outskirts of the city. Forty-five minutes in traffic.

We don't make it five.

She moves first.

Her hands fist in my jacket, fingers digging into blood-soaked fabric like she’s anchoring herself to something real, something alive. Then she yanks me in with brutal strength, no warning, no patience. Her mouth crashes into mine, teeth catching, breath colliding, hunger stripped bare.

It isn’t soft.
It isn’t careful.

It’s a claim.

A violent, unapologetic assertion that whatever this is, it’s already hers as much as it is mine.

I kiss her back just as fiercely, meeting her aggression without flinching. My hand slides up to her throat, fingers settling there with deliberate restraint. I don’t squeeze. I don’t need to. I just hold her, feel her pulse hammering wild and fast beneath my palm.

Alive.
Eager.
Unmistakably thrilled.

She bites my lower lip hard enough to break skin.

Pain blooms sharp and perfect.

I smile against her mouth.

**"Careful,"** I murmur.

**"Or what?"** she challenges, breathless.

I tighten my grip on her throat just enough to make a point.

**"Or I'll show you exactly how rough I can be."**

Her eyes flash with something that isn't fear.

It's anticipation.

**"Prove it,"** she says.

So I do.

I kiss her again, harder this time, unrestrained, letting her feel exactly what she does to me. My other hand slides down, finding the torn fabric of her dress, the bare skin of her thigh where I cut the silk away. She gasps into my mouth, and I swallow the sound, greedy for it.

Her hands are everywhere. Tugging at my jacket, my shirt, fingers sliding through blood and fabric, searching for skin. She finds it, nails dragging down my chest, sharp enough to sting.

Good.

I want her marks on me.

The car hits a bump and we're thrown together, bodies colliding, and suddenly she's in my lap, straddling me, ruined wedding dress hiked up around her hips, thighs bracketing mine.

We're both still covered in blood.

Neither of us cares.

**"You know what I thought,"** she says, breathless, lips swollen, **"when I first saw you at the altar?"**

**"What?"**

**"That you were the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen."**

I raise an eyebrow. **"Thing?"**

**"Not a person,"** she clarifies, voice dropping lower, darker. **"A thing. A weapon. Something built to destroy."**

**"And now?"**

She leans in, lips brushing mine, not quite kissing, just breathing the same air.

**"Now I want to see if you break,"** she whispers. **"Or if you'll break me first."**

Fuck.

This woman is going to ruin me.

Or I'm going to ruin her.

Maybe both.

The car slows. Turns. Gravel crunches beneath the tires, familiar and final. I don’t need to look out the window to know where we are. The gates of my estate are opening for us.

Two minutes.
Maybe less.

I don’t wait.

My hands lock onto her hips, firm, commanding, halting her movement completely. I hold her there, grounded, owned by the moment, and force her to look at me.

Her eyes snap up, bright and dangerous, breath already uneven.

Everything else fades. The driver. The guards. The gates sliding shut behind us.

There is only the space between our bodies, the tension stretched tight enough to snap, and the promise that once the car stops, restraint will be nothing but a memory.

**"Last chance to change your mind,"** I say. **"Once we're inside, I'm not stopping. I'm not gentle. I'm not careful. You understand?"**

She smiles.

Not wide. Not innocent. Just a slow, knowing curve of her mouth that promises damage.

It’s the most dangerous thing I’ve ever seen.

**"Dante,"** she says, **"if you're gentle, I'll be disappointed."**

The car comes to a stop.

The door opens.

I don’t wait for the driver to move. I don’t acknowledge him at all. I lift Vivienne again, decisive, effortless, and carry her out of the car like the world is already finished with its objections.

Straight toward the house.

My house.
The Morelli estate.

Thirty rooms. Fifteen bathrooms. Layers of security designed to repel a small army. Walls that have seen blood, deals, betrayals, and power traded like currency.

None of it matters.

Not the guards. Not the gates sealing shut behind us. Not the history soaked into every stone.

The only thing that matters now is distance.

Closing it.
Erasing it.

Getting her alone.

The staff scatters the moment I step inside, trained instincts kicking in, bodies vanishing down corridors without a word. Good. I don’t want eyes. I don’t want questions. I don’t want anything that breathes between us and what comes next.

I take the stairs two at a time, not slowing, not careful. Vivienne’s arms are locked around my neck, tight, possessive. Her face presses into my throat, lips brushing my pulse with deliberate precision, just enough to make concentration slip, just enough to remind me she knows exactly what she’s doing.

My bedroom.
Master suite.
Top floor.

Privacy. Control.

I kick the door open, carry her inside without breaking stride, and slam it shut behind us with my heel.

The lock clicks.

Final. Absolute.

We’re alone.

Finally.

I set her down, and for a moment, we just stand there, breathing hard, staring at each other. Blood-soaked. Battle-worn. Married for less than an hour and already bound by something darker than vows.

**"So,"** she says, reaching up to touch my face, fingers tracing my jaw. **"What now, husband?"**

I catch her wrist and pull her hand away, stopping her mid-movement. I pin it behind her back, precise and deliberate.

Not rough.
Not cruel.

Just firm.
Just controlled.

Enough to make the message unmistakable.

**"Now,"** I say, voice low and dangerous, **"I find out if you're as dangerous as you pretend to be."**

Her smile is sharp as a blade, all edge and intent, the kind that promises damage long before it ever draws blood.

**"Try me."**

---

### VIVIENNE

He kisses me like he’s trying to devour me.

Like hunger finally given permission to exist. Like restraint snapping clean in half and being thrown away without regret. His hand fists in my hair, grip tight, controlling the angle, dictating the pace.

I let him.

Not because I yield.
Because I want to know how far he’ll push before I turn it against him.

His other hand trails down my spine, slow, deliberate, unmissable. He finds the zipper of what’s left of my dress and pulls it down in one smooth, decisive motion. No hesitation. No ceremony. Fabric slips away from my body, whispering as it pools at my feet.

Exposed.

I should feel vulnerable.

I don’t.

I feel powerful.

Because the way he’s looking at me tells me everything.

Like I’m something sacred and obscene at the same time. Like a sin dressed up as salvation. His gaze doesn’t roam. It locks. Sharp. Reverent. Ruined.

He wants me.

Not as a wife.
Not as a treaty.
Not as a symbol traded between men who mistake power for control.

He wants me as the one thing he can’t tame. Can’t read. Can’t bend to his will no matter how hard he tries.

Something volatile.
Unpredictable.
Dangerous enough to ruin him if he missteps.

Good.

**"Your turn,"** I say, tugging at his shirt.

He releases me only long enough to strip away the barriers.

His jacket shrugs off his shoulders. Buttons come undone. The shirt slips free and falls to the floor like it never mattered. His chest is revealed in full, a brutal map of violence and survival. Old scars cut across muscle, pale and permanent. New bruises bloom dark beneath the skin. And there, unmistakable, the fresh graze where a bullet brushed him earlier, close enough to remind him how thin the margin was.

I press my palm against it.

Heat. Tension. Life.

He hisses, sharp and involuntary, the sound tearing from him before control can catch it.

And the knowledge settles deep in my bones.

I affect him.

**"Hurt?"** I ask.

**"Somewhat."**

I press harder.

**"Good."**

His eyes darken, something feral flickering behind that cold blue, a predator surfacing just beneath the surface. He doesn’t warn me. He grabs me, lifts me effortlessly, and suddenly my back hits the wall, solid and unyielding, his body caging me there.

He presses in close.

Too close.

His mouth finds my throat, teeth scraping skin in a way that isn’t gentle and isn’t meant to be. A promise disguised as a threat.

I gasp, the sound tearing out of me as my nails dig into his shoulders, breaking skin, drawing blood. I don’t pull back. I hold tighter.

He groans against my neck, low and rough, the sound vibrating straight through me, and it’s—

Perfect.

This. This is what I wanted. What I’ve been circling around for years without knowing how to name it. Someone who doesn’t flinch when I push. Doesn’t shatter when I bite back. Someone who doesn’t treat me like glass or a monster to be feared.

Someone who meets me exactly where I stand.

Someone who matches me.

**"Dante,"** I breathe.

**"Say it again,"** he demands, voice rough.

**"Dante."**

He bites down.

Not hard enough to truly hurt. Never that. Just enough to leave intent behind, just enough to claim skin and memory. The sensation detonates through me, sharp and electric, and my body arches instinctively against his, pleasure spiking fast and uncontrollable.

This is insane.

This is perfect.

This is—

He pulls back suddenly.

Breathing hard. Controlled barely holding. His eyes lock onto mine, dark and burning, like he’s just realized the same thing I have.

That whatever this is, it’s already gone too far to be undone.

**"Bed,"** he says. **"Now."**

**"Make me."**

His smile is pure danger.

**"Gladly."**

He carries me to the bed.

Massive. King-size. Black silk sheets stretched tight and waiting. He drops me onto it without ceremony. I bounce once, a breathless laugh tearing free before I can stop it.

And then he’s on me.

Immediately.

His body covers mine, weight settling in, solid and unavoidable. He pins me down, hands braced on either side of my head, heat and tension locking us together as the last trace of distance disappears.

The air between us goes tight.

There’s no gentleness in the way he holds me. No hesitation either. Just certainty. Just intent.

And beneath it all, the unmistakable promise that this is only the beginning.

**"You're used to being in control,"** he says, voice low, lips brushing mine. **"Aren't you?"**

**"Always."**

**"Not here."** His hand wraps around my throat again, gentle but firm. **"Not with me."**

I could fight him.

I know exactly how. I’m trained for it. A dozen techniques rise to the surface instinctively, muscle memory whispering options. A shift of weight. A hooked leg. A sharp twist of the wrist. I could reverse the pin, put him beneath me, remind him just how dangerous I am.

But I don’t.

Because for the first time in my life, I don’t want to.

Something about the way he holds me, the way his control isn’t frantic or insecure but deliberate, earned, makes my instincts quiet instead of scream. He doesn’t need to dominate me to prove anything. He already has my attention. My interest. My consent.

And that’s new.

Terrifying.
Intoxicating.

For once, I want to see what happens if I let go. If I stop calculating exits and counters and simply allow him to take control. To feel what it’s like to surrender not because I’m weaker, but because I choose to.

He makes me want that.

And that, more than anything, is what makes him dangerous.

**"Then take it,"** I whisper.

And he does.

---

### DANTE

I kiss her like I'm claiming territory.

Hard. Deep. Consuming. My hand tightens around her throat, not to hurt—never to hurt—but to feel her pulse racing beneath my palm, wild and uncontrolled, proof that she's as affected by this as I am.

She gasps into my mouth and I swallow the sound, greedy, starving for every response I can pull from her.

Her nails rake down my back, sharp enough to draw blood, and the pain spikes bright and perfect. I groan against her lips, the sound torn from somewhere deep, and she laughs—breathless, dark, victorious.

**"You like that,"** she says. Not a question.

**"Yes."**

**"Good."**

She does it again. Harder this time. Ten lines of fire scoring down my spine, deliberate, possessive, marking me the way I'm marking her.

I pull back just enough to look at her. Flushed. Wild. Eyes bright with something that isn't fear or hesitation but pure, unfiltered hunger.

Beautiful.

Dangerous.

Mine.

The thought surprises me. I don't do possessive. I don't do attachment. But looking at her now—lips swollen, hair tangled, blood still smeared on her skin from the cathedral—I want to brand her. Make it impossible for anyone else to ever touch what's mine.

**"My turn,"** I say, voice rougher than intended.

I shift my weight, pin her wrists above her head with one hand, and use my free hand to map her body. Slow. Deliberate. Learning every curve, every scar, every place that makes her breath hitch.

She's a landscape of violence. A scar along her ribs—knife wound, old, probably from training. Another on her shoulder—bullet graze. Marks of a life lived in the shadows, same as mine.

I trace each one with my fingers, then my mouth.

**"This one?"** I ask, lips against the scar on her ribs.

**"Bratva enforcer. I was fourteen. He underestimated me."**

**"Mistake."**

**"His last one."**

I smile against her skin and move lower.

She arches against me, testing my grip, and I tighten it.

**"Stay still,"** I order.

**"Make me."**

Challenge accepted.

I lean down, press my mouth to the hollow of her throat where her pulse hammers visibly, and bite. Not breaking skin. Just pressure. Just enough to make her gasp and go rigid beneath me.

**"Dante—"**

I don't let her finish. My free hand slides lower, exploring with purpose, and her protest dissolves into a sound that's half gasp, half moan.

Perfect.

I want to learn every sound she makes. Catalog them. Know exactly what earns a gasp versus a moan versus that sharp intake of breath that means I've found something that undoes her.

Then I move lower.

Collarbone—I bite there too, leaving a mark that will bloom purple by morning.

Shoulder—her breath hitches.

The curve of her breast—she arches into me.

Each touch earns a response. A gasp. A shiver. A whispered curse in Russian that I don't understand but definitely appreciate.

**"Dante,"** she breathes, and my name in her mouth sounds like a prayer and a threat all at once.

**"Tell me what you want,"** I say against her skin.

**"You. All of you. Now."**

I lift my head, meet her eyes.

**"Not yet."**

Her eyes flash with frustration and arousal in equal measure.

**"You're torturing me."**

**"I'm savoring you. There's a difference."**

My hand continues its exploration, finding places that make her breath catch, that make her pull against my grip on her wrists, that make her say my name in ways I've never heard anyone say it before.

**"Please,"** she says, and the word is so unexpected, so unlike her, that I nearly give in.

Nearly.

**"Say it again."**

**"Dante, please—"**

I release her wrists.

Immediately her hands are on me, pulling me closer, nails digging into my shoulders, my back, anywhere she can reach. Her mouth finds mine in a kiss that's all teeth and desperation and barely controlled violence.

The control I've been holding onto fractures.

Breaks.

Shatters completely.

---

### VIVIENNE

He loses control.

I feel the exact moment it happens. The shift from deliberate restraint to pure instinct, from calculated seduction to raw need.

And it's glorious.

His hands are everywhere, demanding and possessive, pulling me closer, tighter, like he can't get enough. Like I'm air and he's been drowning. His mouth follows, claiming skin, leaving marks, staking territory I didn't know I'd let anyone claim.

But I'm not passive.

I'm not surrendering completely.

I fight back.

Not to stop him. To match him.

I use the techniques I was taught—leverage, momentum, surprise. I hook my leg around his hip and flip us, reversing our positions in one smooth motion. Suddenly I'm on top, straddling him, hands braced on his chest, hair falling around us like a dark curtain.

He looks up at me, breathing hard, eyes dark and dangerous and absolutely delighted.

**"Trying to take control back?"** he asks.

**"Reminding you who you married,"** I reply.

He grins. Feral and beautiful.

**"Show me."**

So I do.

I lean down, capture his mouth in a bruising kiss while my hands explore freely. Every scar. Every muscle. Every place that makes him tense or groan or grab me harder.

I map his body the way a general maps enemy territory—cataloging weaknesses, pressure points, places to exploit.

A scar across his abdomen—old gunshot wound, poorly healed.

Another on his shoulder—knife, recent.

Bruises from earlier tonight, already darkening.

I press my thumb against the bullet graze on his shoulder—the fresh one from the cathedral—and he hisses, hands tightening on my hips.

**"Still hurt?"** I ask innocently.

**"Yes."**

I press harder.

**"Good."**

His eyes darken dangerously, and before I can react, he's moved. Fast. Controlled. One hand wraps around the back of my neck, pulling me down to him, while the other slides down my spine.

**"Two can play that game,"** he murmurs against my mouth.

**"I'm counting on it."**

I bite his lower lip hard enough to taste copper, and the groan that tears from his throat is the most satisfying sound I've ever heard.

We're both covered in blood still—his, mine, people we killed—and it should be grotesque. Should be wrong.

Instead it feels right.

Like we're baptizing each other in violence. Sealing something that started the moment our eyes met at that altar.

His hands slide up my thighs, grip my hips, and suddenly he's guiding me, setting rhythm and pace with an authority that should annoy me but instead sends heat spiraling through my core.

**"Vivienne,"** he growls, and the sound of my name in his voice—rough, desperate, barely controlled—undoes something inside me.

Something I didn't know could be undone.

I lean down, press my forehead to his, breathing the same air, feeling his heartbeat hammer against my palms where they're pressed to his chest.

**"I've never wanted anyone the way I want you,"** I admit, the truth slipping out before I can stop it.

His eyes lock onto mine, and for a moment, the psychopath, the killer, the heir to a criminal empire—all of it falls away.

What's left is just a man looking at a woman like she's the only real thing in his entire world.

**"Same,"** he says simply.

And then there are no more words.

---

### DANTE

Time fractures.

Stops meaning anything.

There's only sensation. Heat. Pressure. The slide of skin against skin—hers soft where mine is scarred, both of us damaged in different ways but fitting together perfectly anyway.

The sound of her breathing—ragged and wild and beautiful.

The way she says my name like it's the only word that matters.

The way her nails dig into my shoulders when I do something she likes, leaving marks I'll wear tomorrow with pride.

We move together—collision and convergence, control traded back and forth like a weapon neither of us wants to keep for long.

She bites my shoulder hard enough to bruise, and I return the favor, teeth finding the junction of her neck and shoulder, claiming skin that no one else will ever touch.

I leave fingerprints on her hips that will last for days.

She leaves scratches down my back that I'll feel every time I move.

We're destroying each other in the best possible way.

At some point she tries to slow down, tries to regain control, tries to pull back from whatever edge we're both racing toward. I don't let her.

I flip us again, pin her beneath me, and set a pace that's relentless, demanding, designed to strip away every layer of defense she has left.

**"Let go,"** I tell her.

**"I don't—I can't—"**

**"Yes, you can. Let go, Vivienne. I've got you."**

And something in those three words—*I've got you*—breaks through whatever wall she's been hiding behind.

Her entire body goes taut beneath me, trembling, on the edge of something she's never let herself fall into before.

**"Dante—"**

**"I've got you,"** I repeat. **"Let go."**

And she does.

I feel it the moment it happens. The way her entire body shatters, the way my name tears from her throat—raw and unguarded and absolutely perfect. The way she clings to me like I'm the only solid thing in a world that's dissolved around her.

And that—that sound, that moment, that trust—pulls me over the edge with her.

---

### VIVIENNE

The world goes white.

Then black.

Then slowly, gradually, comes back into focus.

I'm still breathing. Still alive. Still tangled with him in sheets that are thoroughly destroyed—torn in places, stained with blood and sweat and evidence of exactly what we just did.

My body aches in a dozen places. Good aches. Earned aches. Evidence of exactly how thoroughly we just wrecked each other.

Dante collapses beside me, breathing just as hard, and for a moment we just lie there, staring at the ceiling, trying to remember how language works.

My mind is still trying to process what just happened.

Not the physical act—I understand that. I've seduced men before. Used my body as a weapon, as a tool, as a means to an end.

This wasn't that.

This was something else entirely.

This was... real.

**"Fuck,"** Dante says eventually.

**"Yeah,"** I agree, because what else is there to say?

He turns his head to look at me, and despite everything we just did—despite the fact that he's seen every part of me, despite the intimacy we just shared—I feel heat rise in my cheeks under that gaze.

Why am I blushing now? After everything?

**"You okay?"** he asks, and there's genuine concern beneath the question.

Not tactical concern. Not strategic assessment.

Real concern.

For me.

When was the last time anyone asked me that and meant it?

**"More than okay,"** I tell him honestly. **"You?"**

**"Never better."**

He reaches out, pulls me against his chest, and I let him. Let myself be held. Let myself feel safe—actually safe, not tactically positioned or strategically placed—for the first time in longer than I can remember.

His fingers trace idle patterns on my shoulder, gentle now, all the violence temporarily burned away.

**"We should probably clean up,"** he says. **"We're both still covered in blood. Some of it isn't even ours."**

He's right. I can feel it—dried and flaking on my skin, mixed with sweat, a physical reminder of the cathedral massacre that feels like it happened years ago instead of hours.

**"In a minute,"** I murmur, not ready to move yet. Not ready to break this moment.

**"In a minute,"** he agrees, and his arms tighten around me slightly.

Silence settles between us. Comfortable. Strange. New.

I listen to his heartbeat. Strong. Steady. Alive.

We both could have died tonight. Multiple times. The attack was coordinated, professional. We survived through skill and luck and sheer bloody-minded refusal to die.

And now we're here.

Together.

Alive.

Then he speaks again, voice quiet, almost vulnerable.

**"I meant what I said earlier. I've never wanted anyone the way I want you."**

I lift my head to look at him properly.

**"Why me?"**

He's silent for a moment, thinking. Then:

**"Because you're the only person who's ever looked at me and seen exactly what I am—and smiled."**

My throat tightens unexpectedly.

**"You're the only person who's ever made me feel anything at all,"** I admit. **"Everyone else is just... static. Background noise. People going through motions I'm supposed to understand but don't. But you—"**

**"I'm loud,"** he finishes.

**"Deafening,"** I correct. **"In the best way. You make the world make sense. Or maybe you make it make less sense but in a way that finally feels honest."**

He kisses the top of my head, and the tenderness of it nearly breaks me.

**"We're fucked up,"** he says.

**"Completely,"** I agree.

**"Good. I wouldn't want it any other way."**

**"Neither would I."**

Another silence, this one heavier. Weighted with things we're both thinking but not saying.

Then I ask the question that's been hovering at the edge of my mind.

**"What happens now?"**

**"Now?"** He considers. **"Now we shower. Now we sleep. Tomorrow we deal with Marco Calabrese and the war he just started. Tomorrow we show both our families that this marriage is real. That we're a united front."**

**"And tonight?"**

**"Tonight we're just Dante and Vivienne. Not heirs. Not soldiers. Just... us."**

Just us.

I like the sound of that.

**"Okay,"** I say softly.

**"Okay."**

He doesn't move though. Neither do I.

**"Round two?"** he asks after a moment, and I can hear the smile in his voice.

I laugh—actually laugh, the sound surprising both of us.

**"You think you can keep up?"**

He shifts, suddenly looming over me again, eyes dark and hungry and absolutely focused.

**"Try me, wife."**

---

### DANTE

“**So,**” she says eventually, her voice rough, worn down to something honest. Her head rests against my chest like it belongs there. “**That was…**”

“**Insane?**”

She exhales, slow and satisfied. “**Perfect.**”

I run my fingers through her hair, the motion uncharacteristically gentle, the violence in me temporarily quieted. Not gone. Just sated. For now.

“**You’re terrifying,**” I tell her.

She doesn’t deny it. Just looks up at me and answers evenly, “**So are you.**”

A corner of my mouth lifts. “**We’re going to destroy each other.**”

She raises her head then, really looks at me, those sharp, merciless eyes cutting straight through whatever defenses I still pretend to have.

“**Probably,” she says, calm as a verdict. “But what a way to go.**”

I pull her closer without thinking, closer than strategy would advise, and press a kiss to her forehead.

The tenderness of it surprises me.

**"Welcome to the family, wife."**

**"Welcome to madness, husband."**

Outside, the sun is sinking toward the horizon, bleeding color across the sky. Blood still stains our skin, dried and tacky, a reminder of how the day began. Somewhere beyond these walls, enemies are regrouping. Schemes are forming. War is drawing breath.

None of it matters.

Not now.

Right now there is only this moment. This room. This bed. Two monsters who met in the middle of a cathedral massacre and recognized themselves in each other without hesitation.

We didn’t negotiate it.
Didn’t question it.
Didn’t pretend it was anything else.

We chose each other.

Forever.

Or until one of us finally decides to put the other down.

Whichever comes first.

## CHAPTER 3: THE MORNING AFTER

### DANTE

Morning brings unexpected guests.

Not exactly unexpected. Just… unwanted. I thought mornings would still belong to just the two of us. I hoped too high.

I wake to the smell of coffee braided with gunpowder, rich and acrid, familiar and deeply wrong. The house feels awake in a way it shouldn't, too still, too alert, like it's holding its breath and waiting for orders. The space beside me in the bed is empty. Cold.

Apparently, we're not the kind of people who do morning cuddles.

Figures.

I follow the scent into the kitchen.

Vivienne is already there.

She's perched on the island in nothing but my shirt, bare legs hooked around the stool, completely unbothered by the world she's just thrown off balance. The fabric hangs loose on her, stolen and claimed, and her hair is a beautiful mess of dark intent, wild from sleep and sin. Somehow she looks even more lethal like this. More beautiful. It should be illegal.

In her hands, her favorite knife glints as it catches the light. She cleans it slowly, lovingly, every motion precise and intimate, like a ritual she's performed a thousand times. Calm. Controlled. Tender in a way that has nothing to do with softness and everything to do with danger.

Calm.
Domestic.
Lethal.

God help me, I swallow hard, already picturing my hands on her again, lifting her, carrying her back to the bedroom we barely managed to leave last night.

She notices.

Of course she does.

She gestures casually toward the coffee and the small breakfast she's prepared, eggs still steaming, toast laid out with deceptive neatness. I barely register any of it. The room softens at the edges, everything else fading out of focus.

She speaks softly without looking up, never breaking the slow, deliberate rhythm of the blade in her hands, like she knows exactly what she's doing to me and has no intention of stopping.

**"We have a guest this morning, husband."**

She isn't alone.

My father, Lorenzo Morelli, sits at the table like he owns the day, espresso cradled in one hand. Across from him, Dmitri Rostov mirrors the posture, the same predator stillness, the same calculating patience. Two kings sharing caffeine and silence, watching. Measuring. Tracking every movement we make.

Their eyes flick to our necks. Then to my bare torso. I'm wearing nothing but boxers, having assumed the morning would be private, uncomplicated.

It isn't.

The evidence is impossible to miss. Scratches raked deep and unapologetic. Bite marks darkening skin. Bruises blooming where fingers dug in. Hickeys scattered across us like signatures, careless and intimate, marking territory without shame.

My father arches a brow.

**"Do I even want to ask?"** he says dryly, sarcasm sharpened into a blade.

Dmitri doesn't smile. He barely looks at either of us, clearly refusing to process the sight. **"Last night was… unexpected,"** he says stiffly. **"And now this. But we need to talk about Marco Calabrese's head. The one you left on his mother's doorstep at three in the morning. With a wedding bow."**

I blink.

Wait. What?

Vivienne's knife stills mid-stroke. Our eyes meet across the room, a single, silent exchange of certainty.

We didn't do that.
Neither of us left the house.

Vivienne laughs.

Then she says brightly, **"I can reassure you, Father, that there is absolutely no chance either of us did anything outside our bedroom last night,"** she says smoothly, a faint, wicked curve playing at her lips. **"We were… quite preoccupied."**

Her gaze slides to me as she says it, deliberate and unhurried, locking onto mine with intention. There's an invitation in her eyes, a slow pull back into memory, into heat and shadows and everything we did not bother to regret. Then she winks.

Just once.

So smooth, so perfectly timed, it catches me off guard and hits harder than it should. For a split second, the room blurs again, replaced by silk sheets and breathless sounds and the way her nails dug into my skin.

She knows exactly what she's doing.

And she enjoys every second of it.

My father chokes on his coffee.

Silence slams into the room, thick and stunned. He absolutely did not expect that level of blunt honesty from his new daughter-in-law. Vivienne, meanwhile, goes right back to what she was doing, calm, unbothered, not a hint of embarrassment in her posture. I catch a glimpse of something else in her expression.

Pride.

But the facts don't change.

Neither of us did it.

Which means only one thing.

Someone is framing us.

And worse, they're doing it loudly. Publicly. With flair.

Someone just declared war in our names.

---

### DANTE

Someone walks into the kitchen.

Casually. Calmly. Like she belongs there.

A woman—no. A girl. Thirteen, maybe fifteen at most. Too young. Far too young for the way she moves, for the way dried blood stains her clothes like an afterthought. None of it is hers. That's immediately clear.

In her hand, she carries Marco Calabrese's wedding ring.

**"Morning, lovebirds,"** she says cheerfully. **"I wanted to come see you both right after last night. Thought about knocking. Thought about kicking the door in. But you were… well."** She smiles, unbothered. **"Loud. I figured I'd be welcome once you finished."**

Guns come up in seconds.

My father. Dmitri. Guards. Fingers tense, barrels steady, all trained on her heart, her head, her future.

Everyone reacts—

Except my wife.

Vivienne doesn't even look up.

She keeps polishing her blade, slow and precise, as if a blood-soaked teenager strolling into our kitchen is the least interesting thing that's happened today. She doesn't blink. Doesn't tense. Doesn't acknowledge the girl's existence at all.

**"I'm not here to fight,"** the girl says easily. **"I'm here to confess."**

She tosses the ring onto the table. It skids across polished wood and comes to a stop between us.

**"I killed Marco. I left the head. I framed you."**

The room tightens.

Vivienne finally speaks, voice calm, almost bored.

**"Why?"**

The girl's eyes light up, like she's been waiting for that question.

**"Because I wanted to meet you properly,"** she says. **"I'm Sera Volkov. I've been studying you. Learning from you. You're legends where I come from. The Viper and the Devil."** Her smile sharpens. **"I needed to know if the stories were true."**

My father cuts in coldly. **"Who sent you?"**

Sera laughs. Not nervous. Not defensive.

**"Pain?"** she says lightly. **"Loneliness?"** She shrugs. **"Hard to say."**

Then her tone shifts. Not softer. Just… heavier.

**"Marco Calabrese murdered my family,"** she continues. **"Slowly. Methodically. My mother first. Then my father. My brothers. My little sister."** Her smile never quite leaves, but something hollow flickers behind it. **"I hid under the floorboards and listened to him laugh while it happened."**

No one interrupts.

**"He kept me alive,"** Sera goes on. **"Not mercy. Entertainment. Made me clean his knives. Made me watch. Taught me things. I learned fast."** She tilts her head. **"Eventually, I learned enough."**

She straightens.

**"I want in. I want to learn from the best. I want to join your… partnership."**

**"By framing us for murder?"** I ask, the words slipping out before I can stop them, disbelief cracking my composure despite every instinct telling me not to show it.

**"By giving you the most expensive wedding gift,"** she replies evenly, as if correcting a minor misunderstanding. **"Marco was planning to kill you both within the week. Publicly. Brutally."** A pause, deliberate. Surgical. **"I just moved up the timeline."**

Her smile comes slow and satisfied, the kind that belongs to someone who knows exactly how much blood they've saved by spilling it first.

**"You're welcome."**

She slides a USB drive across the table. It stops right at my fingertips.

**"Proof of the Calabrese plot,"** she continues, voice smooth, almost indulgent. **"Blueprints of this house. Ambush routes. Names of every family member involved. Accounts. Safe houses."** Her eyes catch the light, sharp with promise, alive in a way most people never are. **"Everything you need to wipe them out completely."**

Vivienne picks up the drive and turns it over once, slow and thoughtful, examining it like a relic pulled from a crime scene museum. Her expression doesn't change. Calm. Measured. Dangerous.

Then she looks at me.

**"She's insane,"** she says flatly.

**"Completely,"** I answer without hesitation.

Sera's grin stretches wider, sharp and delighted, like she's just been paid a compliment. **"Takes one to know one."** She spreads her hands in a mock show of surrender, blood still crusted beneath her nails. **"So?"**

Her eyes flick between us, bright and fearless.

**"Do I get to stay,"** she asks lightly, **"or do you kill me?"**

My father watches.
Dmitri watches.

Everyone waits.

The silence stretches taut, dangerous, ready to snap.

I study her. Really study her.

This girl—this *child*—just walked into a room full of killers and confessed to framing two of the deadliest people in the underworld. Either she's suicidal, or she's exactly what she claims to be: insane, brilliant, and far too dangerous to ignore.

The blood on her clothes isn't just dried. It's layered. Multiple kills. Multiple days. She's been hunting, systematically eliminating threats we didn't even know existed yet.

And she did it all to get our attention.

**"How did you get past security?"** I ask instead of answering.

She doesn't hesitate. **"Third floor. East wing. Guard rotation changes at 6:47 AM. Four-minute gap. Climbed the drainpipe, disabled the motion sensors, bypassed three locks, and made myself at home in your library."** A beat. **"Nice book collection, by the way. Didn't know you were into Nietzsche."**

My father's expression darkens. That information is classified. Our security protocols are airtight, changed weekly, known only to inner circle personnel.

She shouldn't know any of this.

**"How long have you been watching us?"** Vivienne asks, and there's something new in her voice. Not anger. Interest.

**"Three years,"** Sera answers honestly. **"Since I escaped Marco. I needed to learn. Needed to understand what real power looked like."** Her gaze locks onto Vivienne with something approaching reverence. **"You killed seventeen men in under four minutes in Prague. No backup. No hesitation. I watched the security footage fourteen times, frame by frame, studying your movement patterns."**

Then she looks at me.

**"And you,"** she continues. **"Detroit. The Antonov job. You walked into a building with forty-two armed guards and walked out two hours later without a single gunshot. Just a building full of corpses and a signed confession from their boss."** Her eyes gleam. **"Psychological warfare at its finest. Beautiful work."**

My spine goes cold.

Those jobs were off-book. Untraceable. No witnesses. No records.

And this fifteen-year-old kid just recited them like a resume.

**"You've been stalking us,"** my father says, voice granite-hard.

**"Studying,"** Sera corrects. **"There's a difference. Stalkers are obsessed. I'm strategic."** She gestures at the USB drive. **"I'm also useful. That drive contains everything the Calabrese family has been planning for the last eight months. Including the names of their informants in both your organizations."**

Dmitri speaks for the first time since she arrived, voice cold and calculating. **"Informants?"**

**"Two in the Bratva. Three in the Morelli family."** Sera's smile sharpens. **"One of them is in this room."**

Every gun in the room shifts.

My father's eyes narrow dangerously. Dmitri goes very, very still. The guards look at each other, suspicion blooming instant and vicious.

Sera just watches, delighted, like she's conducting an orchestra and we're all playing exactly the notes she wants.

**"Relax,"** she says. **"It's not the guards. It's not your fathers. It's someone close enough to know your schedules, your safe houses, your vulnerabilities."** She pauses for effect. **"Someone who's been feeding information to Marco for months. Someone who helped plan yesterday's cathedral attack."**

Vivienne sets down her knife.

Slowly. Deliberately.

When she speaks, her voice is silk over steel. **"Give me a name."**

Sera tilts her head, considering. **"What do I get in return?"**

**"Your life,"** Vivienne says simply.

**"I already have that,"** Sera counters. **"If you wanted me dead, I'd be dead. You're curious now. You want to know what else I know. What else I can do."** She leans forward, hands flat on the table, fearless. **"So here's my offer: I give you the name. I give you the evidence. I help you burn the Calabrese family to the ground and hunt down every rat in your organizations."**

She pauses.

**"And in return, you let me stay. You train me. You teach me everything you know."** Her eyes flick between me and Vivienne. **"I want to be like you. Both of you. I want to be so good at what I do that people tell stories about me the way they tell stories about the Viper and the Devil."**

The audacity of it is staggering.

This girl walks into our home, confesses to multiple murders, reveals a conspiracy within our own families, and then has the nerve to ask for an apprenticeship.

And the worst part?

I'm actually considering it.

---

### VIVIENNE

I watch her.

This strange, blood-soaked child who speaks like a soldier and moves like a ghost.

Sera Volkov.

I've heard that name before. Whispers in Bratva circles. A ghost story. The girl who disappeared. The one Marco Calabrese kept as a pet for two years before she vanished without a trace.

We assumed she was dead.

Clearly, we were wrong.

She's not just alive. She's *thriving*. Feral and focused and absolutely unafraid of dying, which makes her the most dangerous kind of person.

The kind with nothing left to lose.

I recognize it immediately because I see it in the mirror every morning.

**"The name,"** I say again, voice quiet but unyielding.

Sera meets my eyes. She doesn't blink. Doesn't flinch.

**"Claudia Moretti,"** she says. **"Dante's cousin. Head of intelligence operations. She's been on Marco's payroll for sixteen months. She helped plan the cathedral attack. She's the one who gave them your security protocols."**

The room detonates.

My father-in-law moves first, rage white-hot and barely controlled. **"Claudia is FAMILY—"**

**"Claudia is a traitor,"** Sera interrupts calmly. **"Check her financials. Offshore accounts in the Caymans. Three million dollars deposited over the last year, all from Calabrese shell companies."** She gestures at the USB. **"Bank statements. Email correspondence. Voice recordings. Everything you need to confirm it."**

Dante hasn't moved. Hasn't spoken.

But I can see it in his eyes. The gears turning. The pieces clicking into place.

Claudia was the one who insisted on the cathedral venue. Claudia arranged the security detail. Claudia had access to everything.

If this is true—if Sera is telling the truth—then we've been compromised from the inside since before the wedding even happened.

**"Why should we believe you?"** I ask.

Sera looks at me like I've just asked the most interesting question of her life.

**"Because I'm exactly like you,"** she says simply. **"I don't lie. I don't need to. Lying is for people who are afraid of consequences."** She spreads her hands. **"I killed Marco Calabrese and left his head on his mother's doorstep with a bow. I walked into a house full of mob bosses and confessed to framing two psychopaths for murder. I'm either telling the truth, or I'm the stupidest person you've ever met."**

She leans back, perfectly relaxed.

**"And I don't think you believe I'm stupid."**

She's right.

I don't.

This girl is many things—broken, feral, dangerous beyond measure—but she's not stupid.

I pick up the USB drive, turn it over in my fingers, feeling the weight of it. The weight of what it represents.

**"If you're lying,"** I tell her, voice soft and lethal, **"I will skin you alive. Slowly. Artistically. I'll make it last for days."**

Sera's smile doesn't waver.

**"If I'm lying,"** she says, **"I'll hand you the knife myself."**

I believe her.

God help me, I actually believe her.

I look at Dante. Our eyes meet across the kitchen, and in that moment, we have an entire conversation without saying a word.

*She's dangerous.*

*She's useful.*

*She knows too much.*

*She could be an asset.*

*She's a child.*

*She stopped being a child the moment Marco Calabrese murdered her family.*

*What do we do?*

The question hangs between us, unspoken but understood.

And then Dante does something that surprises everyone in the room.

He laughs.

Not bitter. Not cruel.

Genuinely amused, the sound rich and unexpected, filling the kitchen like smoke.

**"Fucking hell,"** he says, shaking his head. **"We've been married less than twenty-four hours and we're already adopting strays."**

My lips twitch despite myself.

**"She did give us a severed head as a wedding gift,"** I point out. **"That's more thoughtful than anything our actual guests brought."**

**"True,"** he concedes. He looks at Sera. **"You understand what you're asking for? This isn't a game. This isn't a training program. We don't do mentorship. We don't do second chances. You fuck up, you die. Simple as that."**

**"I understand,"** Sera says.

**"You'll do exactly what we tell you, when we tell you, without question."**

**"Yes."**

**"You'll live in this house, under our rules, under our watch. No privacy. No secrets. No mercy if you betray us."**

**"I wouldn't want it any other way."**

Dante looks at his father. At Dmitri. At the guards still holding weapons trained on a fifteen-year-old girl.

**"Lower your guns,"** he says quietly.

No one moves.

**"I said lower your guns."**

This time, they obey.

Slowly, reluctantly, barrels drop. Safeties click back on. The tension doesn't disappear, but it shifts, recalibrates into something just slightly less lethal.

Dante stands, walks over to Sera, and extends his hand.

**"Welcome to the family,"** he says. **"Don't make me regret this."**

Sera takes his hand. Her grip is firm, calloused, the hands of someone who's held weapons far too young.

**"I won't,"** she promises.

Then she looks at me.

Waiting.

I stand, move to join them, and the three of us form a strange, bloodstained triangle in the middle of my kitchen.

**"First rule,"** I tell her. **"Never lie to us."**

**"Second rule,"** Dante adds. **"Loyalty above everything. Even survival."**

**"Third rule,"** I continue. **"If you kill someone, make sure they deserve it."**

Sera nods, absorbing each command like scripture.

**"And the fourth rule?"** she asks.

Dante and I exchange a glance.

**"Don't get caught,"** we say in unison.

Sera grins, bright and feral and absolutely delighted.

**"I can work with that."**

---

### DANTE

My father looks like he wants to shoot someone.

Possibly me.

Possibly Sera.

Possibly everyone in the room and then himself.

**"You can't be serious,"** he says, voice tight with barely controlled fury. **"You're taking in a stranger? A CHILD? Who just confessed to framing you for murder?"**

**"She's not a stranger,"** I counter. **"She's been studying us for three years. She knows our routines better than half our own people."** I gesture at the USB drive. **"And she just handed us intelligence that could win this war before it even starts."**

**"Or she's a plant,"** Lorenzo shoots back. **"A Calabrese spy sent to infiltrate our organization."**

**"Marco Calabrese murdered her entire family,"** Vivienne says, voice cold and final. **"She's not working for them. She's working against them. Against everyone."** She picks up the ring from the table. **"And she's good enough to kill their heir without leaving evidence. That's not a spy. That's a weapon."**

Dmitri speaks, his Russian accent thicker when he's thinking strategically. **"Even if intelligence is legitimate, she is unstable. Unpredictable. Dangerous."**

**"So are we,"** I point out.

Silence.

Because he can't argue with that.

**"We'll verify the information on the drive,"** I say, making it a statement, not a request. **"If Sera's telling the truth about Claudia, we move on her tonight. Quietly. Thoroughly. And we use whatever else is on that drive to dismantle the Calabrese network piece by piece."**

**"And if she's lying?"** my father asks.

I look at Sera. She looks back, unflinching.

**"Then I'll kill her myself,"** I say simply.

**"I'll help,"** Vivienne adds.

Sera just shrugs, unbothered by the casual discussion of her potential execution.

**"Fair enough,"** she says.

My father and Dmitri exchange a long look. The kind that speaks volumes without words. The kind that happens between men who've ruled criminal empires for decades and know exactly how fragile power can be.

Finally, Lorenzo exhales sharply.

**"Fine,"** he says. **"But she's YOUR responsibility. She fucks up, it's on you. She betrays us, you handle it. Understood?"**

**"Understood,"** I confirm.

Dmitri nods slowly. **"I will have my people verify information independently. If there are moles in Bratva, I want them found. Tonight."**

**"Agreed,"** Vivienne says.

The two patriarchs stand, finishing their coffee with grim finality. This impromptu family breakfast has officially devolved into a war council, and we all know it.

**"One more thing,"** my father says, pausing at the door. He looks at Sera. **"If you ever threaten my family again—if you ever put them at risk—I will personally ensure you spend your last moments begging for death."**

Sera meets his gaze without fear.

**"Noted,"** she says.

Then she smiles.

**"But respectfully, sir, your family was already at risk. I just exposed it."**

Lorenzo's jaw tightens, but he doesn't argue. Can't argue. Because she's right.

After they leave—fathers, guards, the whole intimidating entourage—the kitchen falls into a strange, loaded silence.

Just the three of us now.

Me. Vivienne. And Sera.

Our bizarre, blood-soaked new family dynamic.

**"So,"** Sera says brightly, breaking the tension. **"What's for breakfast? I'm starving."**

Vivienne stares at her.

I stare at her.

Then Vivienne laughs. Actually laughs, the sound sharp and genuine and so unexpected that it catches even me off guard.

**"I like her,"** she says, looking at me.

**"God help us both,"** I mutter.

But I'm smiling too.

---

### VIVIENNE

I cook.

It’s strange. Domestic. Almost surreal in how wrong it feels.

Twenty-four hours ago, my husband and I slaughtered twenty-two people at our own wedding. Blood on marble. Screams echoing through silk and crystal. A celebration turned massacre without missing a beat.

Now I’m standing at the stove, quietly scrambling eggs for a teenage assassin who showed up hours earlier with a severed head like a housewarming gift.

Life has a warped sense of humor.

Sera leans against the counter, watching me work. Not casually. Not politely. She studies my movements with focus sharp enough to cut glass, the same intensity she probably used to memorize escape routes and kill patterns. Every flick of the wrist. Every pause. Learning. Cataloging. Absorbing.

As if even this, too, is a weapon she intends to master.

**"You're left-handed,"** she observes. **"But you shoot right-handed. Why?"**

**"Versatility,"** I answer, cracking eggs into a bowl. **"If my dominant hand is injured, I don't become useless."**

**"Smart."**

Dante leans against the counter, scrolling through the contents of the USB drive on his laptop. His expression darkens with every file he opens.

**"She's not lying,"** he says quietly. **"Claudia's financials are exactly where Sera said they'd be. Three million in offshore accounts. Email trails. Meeting logs."** He looks up, and there's murder in his eyes. **"She's been feeding the Calabrese family our intel since before the engagement was even announced."**

Fury coils in my chest, cold and precise, tightening with the patience of something that knows it will be used.

Claudia.

I met her twice. She’d seemed competent. Professional. The kind of woman who understood her place and kept it without complaint. Trustworthy, at least by the standards of our world.

Apparently, I was wrong.

**"How do you want to handle it?"** I ask.

**"Personally,"** Dante says. **"Tonight. After we've extracted everything she knows."**

He doesn’t need to elaborate.

I understand perfectly.

Claudia won’t die quickly.

**"There's more,"** he continues, scrolling further. **"The Calabrese family has been planning this for months. The cathedral attack wasn't improvised—it was phase one of a three-phase operation."**

**"What's phase two?"** Sera asks.

**"Assassinate both our fathers,"** Dante reads. **"Frame it as internal family conflict. Let the organizations tear themselves apart from the inside."**

**"And phase three?"**

**"Move in during the chaos. Absorb both territories. Consolidate power."**

I set down the spatula, appetite gone.

**"When?"**

**"Phase two was scheduled for tomorrow night,"** Dante says. **"During the joint family dinner."**

The family dinner.

The one meant to publicly display unity between the Morelli and Rostov families. A carefully staged performance of loyalty and peace. Both our fathers seated in the same room, surrounded by dozens of people, any one of them compromised, bought, or already dead and just waiting to fall.

It’s the perfect setup for an assassination.

And we almost walked straight into it.

**"We need to cancel,"** I say.

**"We can't,"** Dante counters. **"If we cancel, we look weak. Scared. The other families will sense blood in the water."**

**"If we don't cancel, our fathers die."**

**"Not if we flip the script,"** Sera interjects.

We both look at her.

She's smiling. That same feral, delighted expression that says she's three steps ahead and enjoying every second of it.

**"You don't cancel the dinner,"** she explains. **"You turn it into a trap. You know they're coming. You know their plan. So you let them walk into YOUR kill box instead of the other way around."**

Dante's eyes light up with understanding.

**"A counter-ambush,"** he says slowly.

**"Exactly,"** Sera confirms. **"They're expecting security as usual. Routine protocols. They've planned for that. But what if you change everything? What if you control every variable?"**

I start to see it. The shape of it forming in my mind like a blueprint written in blood.

**"We use Claudia,"** I say. **"Feed her false information. Let her think the plan is proceeding as expected."**

**"Meanwhile, we replace our security with people we trust absolutely,"** Dante adds. **"People who haven't been compromised."**

**"And when the Calabrese hitters show up,"** Sera finishes, **"they walk into a room full of people who know exactly what they're planning and are ready to kill them for it."**

The plan crystallizes, sharp and perfect.

**"We'll need to move fast,"** Dante says. **"Verify everyone on the security team. Root out the other moles. And we need to make Claudia believe everything is normal until the exact moment we want her to know it's not."**

**"I can help with that,"** Sera offers. **"I'm good at surveillance. Infiltration. Making people disappear."**

I hand her a plate of eggs.

**"Eat first,"** I tell her. **"You can't help us if you pass out from hunger."**

She takes the plate, and for just a moment, the hardness in her expression cracks. She looks exactly like what she is: a fifteen-year-old kid who's been fighting to survive for years and just realized she might have finally found somewhere safe.

**"Thank you,"** she says quietly.

**"Don't thank us yet,"** Dante warns. **"You haven't seen how we work."**

**"That's why I'm here,"** Sera says. **"To learn."**

She digs into the food like she hasn't eaten in days. Which, based on the state of her clothes, might actually be true.

Dante and I exchange another look.

*What the hell did we just get ourselves into?*

The question hovers between us, unspoken and enormous.

But neither of us suggests sending her away.

Because the truth is, as insane as this is, as reckless and potentially catastrophic—

Sera might be exactly what we need.

A wild card. An unknown variable. Someone who thinks like us but isn't bound by the same rules and hierarchies.

Someone who's just crazy enough to help us win an unwinnable war.

---

### DANTE

The rest of the morning passes in organized chaos.

Vivienne and I work through the files on the USB drive, cross-referencing names, accounts, communications. Every piece of evidence Sera provided checks out. Every claim she made is backed by documentation.

She's either telling the truth, or she's orchestrated the most elaborate con I've ever seen.

I'm betting on the former.

Sera, meanwhile, makes herself useful. She's downloaded the building schematics, marked entry points, identified security weaknesses, and flagged seventeen potential vulnerabilities in our current protocols.

All before noon.

**"You're thorough,"** I observe.

**"I had good teachers,"** she says darkly. Then, lighter: **"And a lot of time to practice."**

She doesn't elaborate. Doesn't need to.

Two years with Marco Calabrese. Two years of surviving hell.

The fact that she's functional at all is a miracle.

The fact that she's this competent is terrifying.

By early afternoon, we have a plan.

1. Verify Claudia's betrayal independently.
2. Extract her tonight, quietly, and interrogate her for additional intelligence.
3. Use her credentials to feed false information to the Calabrese network.
4. Replace security for tomorrow's dinner with verified loyalists.
5. Set the trap.
6. Eliminate every Calabrese operative who shows up.

Simple. Clean. Brutal.

Exactly the kind of plan I like.

**"We move on Claudia at 8 PM,"** I say. **"She'll be at her apartment. Alone."**

**"How do you know?"** Sera asks.

**"Because I'm about to call her and tell her I need to discuss updated security protocols,"** I explain. **"She'll stay home and wait for my call. She won't suspect anything."**

**"And when you get there?"**

Vivienne smiles. Cold. Beautiful. Deadly.

**"When we get there,"** she says, **"she's going to tell us everything she knows. And then she's going to disappear."**

Sera nods, understanding perfectly.

**"Can I watch?"** she asks.

**"No,"** Vivienne and I say simultaneously.

She pouts. **"Why not?"**

**"Because you're fifteen,"** I say.

**"I've tortured people before,"** she counters. **"Marco made me—"**

**"This is different,"** Vivienne interrupts gently. **"This is family business. And you're not ready."**

**"When will I be ready?"**

**"When you stop asking to watch,"** I tell her.

She considers this. Then nods.

**"Fair enough."**

The casual acceptance is somehow more disturbing than if she'd argued.

This kid has seen too much. Done too much. And now we're responsible for her.

God help us all.

---

At 7:45 PM, Vivienne and I leave Sera at the house with strict instructions not to kill anyone, blow anything up, or leave the property.

She promises nothing.

We drive to Claudia's apartment in silence, both of us mentally preparing for what comes next.

Interrogation is an art form. And Vivienne is a master.

When we arrive, Claudia answers the door with a smile. Professional. Warm. Completely unsuspecting.

**"Dante! I wasn't expecting you in person. Come in, come in."**

We step inside.

The door closes behind us.

And her smile falters.

**"Is something wrong?"** she asks.

**"Actually, yes,"** I say. **"We have some questions about the cathedral security protocols. Specifically, how the Calabrese family knew exactly where to attack."**

Her face goes carefully blank.

**"I... I don't understand."**

**"Yes, you do,"** Vivienne says, voice soft and lethal.

Then she moves.

Fast. Precise. Terrifying.

In three seconds, Claudia is on the floor, hands zip-tied behind her back, Vivienne's knee pressed against her spine.

**"Let's try this again,"** Vivienne says. **"How much did they pay you to betray us?"**

Claudia's breathing goes ragged.

**"I don't—I didn't—"**

I pull out my phone, open the financial records, and show her the screen.

**"Three million dollars,"** I say. **"Offshore accounts. Calabrese shell companies. We have everything, Claudia. Emails. Recordings. Bank statements."**

Her face crumples.

**"It wasn't supposed to be like this,"** she whispers. **"They said no one would get hurt. They just wanted information. They said—"**

**"They lied,"** Vivienne interrupts. **"And you were stupid enough to believe them."**

**"Please,"** Claudia begs. **"Please, I can fix this. I can help you. I can—"**

**"You're going to help us,"** I confirm. **"You're going to tell us everything you told them. Every meeting. Every contact. Every piece of intelligence you compromised."**

**"And then?"** she asks, voice breaking.

**"And then you disappear,"** Vivienne says simply.

Claudia starts to cry.

We don't care.

---

Three hours later, we have everything.

Names. Locations. Plans. Contingencies layered on top of contingencies. The full architecture of betrayal laid bare.

Claudia talked.

She begged. She pleaded. She promised anything she thought might buy her another breath.

None of it mattered.

Traitors don’t get second chances.

When it’s over, Vivienne handles the end. Quick. Professional. Clean in the way only she can make death look inevitable.

One shot. Silenced. Absolute.

Claudia Moretti, head of Morelli intelligence operations and Calabrese informant, ceases to exist.

We burn the body. Reduce flesh and bone to ash. Dispose of what remains. Scrub every digital and physical trace until even memory feels unreliable.

By midnight, it’s as if she was never born at all.

---

When we return home, Sera is exactly where we left her, sitting at the kitchen table, cleaning weapons she apparently found in our armory.

**"How did it go?"** she asks without looking up.

**"She talked,"** Vivienne says. **"We have everything we need for tomorrow."**

**"Good."**

Sera sets down the gun she's been working on and looks at us properly.

**"Thank you,"** she says. **"For letting me stay. For trusting me."**

**"We don't trust you,"** I correct. **"Not yet. Trust is earned."**

**"Then I'll earn it,"** she says simply.

And somehow, I believe her.

Tomorrow, we spring the trap.

Tomorrow, we end this war before it ever has the chance to become real.

Tomorrow, the Calabrese family learns exactly what happens when you come for the Viper and the Devil.

But tonight?

Tonight, we rest.

Plan.

Prepare.

And somewhere in the dark, in the quiet between heartbeats, I catch myself thinking that maybe—just maybe—this twisted, broken, bloodstained family we’re building might actually survive.

---

### DANTE

I cling to that thought like an anchor, let it steady my pulse. I keep my face composed, my movements deliberate, mirroring the calm my wife wears so effortlessly. Vivienne has already turned away, but she pauses at the bedroom door, fingers resting against the frame. She doesn't look back. She doesn't need to.

The message is clear.

*Don't make me wait.*

I understand.

I take Sera down the corridor, our footsteps soft against the floor. The house feels vast at this hour, stretched thin by silence. I choose a room far from ours, intentionally distant, insulated by walls and space. She's still a child, no matter how much blood she's spilled, and there are boundaries she doesn't need crossed tonight. Some things should remain unheard. Unseen.

I make sure she's settled. The door closes. The lock clicks into place. Safe.

Only then do I turn back.

The walk to our bedroom feels longer now, heavier. The air changes with every step, charged with something darker, more intimate. Behind that door waits Vivienne, patience sharpened into expectation, restraint held by a single thread. Tomorrow belongs to war. To strategy. To bodies falling.

But tonight is claimed by something else entirely.

I open the door and step inside, leaving the rest of the world sealed away behind me.

---

I've already seen every inch of my wife's body. Last night burned that knowledge into memory, stripped away any illusion that there could still be surprises between us. And yet—

She's stretched across the bed, bare, unguarded, the low light tracing the elegant lines of her form like it was made for no other purpose. Nothing covers her. Nothing needs to.

I stop without meaning to. My breath catches, held a second too long, as if my body forgot how to do something as simple as inhale.

She is still devastating.

Not just beautiful in the obvious way, but composed, deliberate, dangerous even in rest. Curves that promise softness, stillness that hides teeth. A woman who looks like temptation and consequence wrapped into one.

I've seen her kill without hesitation. I've watched blood dry on her hands.

And standing there, in the quiet, with the door closed and the world shut out, all I can think is the same simple, treacherous truth.

*She really is beautiful.*

**"Are you going to stand there all night,"** she asks without opening her eyes, **"or are you going to come to bed?"**

**"I'm appreciating the view."**

**"You had the view last night."**

**"It hasn't gotten old yet."**

Her lips curve. Slight. Satisfied.

**"Good answer."**

I move toward her, shedding clothes as I go. Each piece falls where it lands, forgotten before it hits the floor. By the time I reach the bed, there's nothing between us but intention.

The mattress dips as I join her. She shifts, turns toward me, eyes open now, dark and focused. Her hand finds my chest, palm flat against my heartbeat, feeling the rhythm accelerate under her touch.

**"Busy day tomorrow,"** she murmurs.

**"Mm."**

**"We should sleep."**

**"We should."**

Neither of us moves.

Her fingers trace the scar on my ribs, following the old wound with precision, like she's memorizing topography. I catch her wrist, bring her hand to my mouth, press a kiss to her palm.

**"You're distracting me,"** I tell her.

**"That's the idea."**

**"We need rest."**

**"We need this more."**

She's right. She's always right.

I pull her closer, eliminating distance, erasing the space that doesn't belong between us anyway. Her skin is warm, impossibly soft against mine, a contrast that shouldn't work but does. Everything about her is contradictions. Gentle violence. Careful destruction. A killer who makes me feel safe.

**"Dante,"** she whispers against my mouth.

**"Vivienne."**

Her name tastes like danger and promise.

I kiss her. Slow this time. Thorough. Learning her all over again, cataloging responses, memorizing the way she sighs into my mouth when I angle just right, when pressure and gentleness balance perfectly.

Last night was collision. Desperation. Two people discovering they fit.

Tonight is different.

Tonight is confirmation.

Her hands map my body with purpose, retracing paths she found yesterday, finding new ones. She presses against the bullet wound on my shoulder—healed but still tender—and I hiss.

**"Still hurts?"** she asks.

**"Yes."**

She does it again. Deliberately. Then leans down and kisses the same spot, lips soft where her fingers were cruel.

The duality nearly kills me.

I flip us, reversing positions, pinning her beneath me with careful weight. Her hair spreads across the pillow like dark water, wild and beautiful and mine.

**"My turn,"** I say.

**"Make it count."**

I intend to.

I explore her slowly, methodically, learning what makes her gasp versus what makes her moan. The hollow of her throat—kiss, not bite. The curve of her collarbone—bite, definitely. Her ribs, where that old knife scar lives—trace with fingers, then with tongue.

She arches beneath me, body responding before her mind can stop it, and the trust in that—the surrender—hits harder than it should.

**"Dante—"**

**"I've got you."**

**"I know."**

Three words. Simple. Devastating.

She knows. She trusts. She's letting go.

For me.

The realization does something dangerous to my chest, tightens something I didn't know could be tightened. This isn't just physical anymore. It stopped being just physical the moment we chose each other at that altar.

This is something else.

Something I don't have words for.

Something that terrifies me more than any bullet or blade ever could.

I pour everything into touch. Into sensation. Into showing her without words what I can't say out loud. My hands worship scars and softness equally. My mouth traces patterns only she will ever know. I learn her body the way I'd learn a weapon—thoroughly, obsessively, until I could navigate blind.

**"Please,"** she breathes, and the word is permission and demand all at once.

**"Say it again."**

**"Please, Dante. Now."**

I obey.

---

### VIVIENNE

Time blurs.

Minutes. Hours. Heartbeats strung together until they lose meaning.

There's only sensation. Heat pooling low and insistent. The weight of him, solid and real and *mine*. The way he looks at me like I'm the only thing in the world that matters. Like I'm dangerous and sacred and he can't decide which is more intoxicating.

He moves with purpose. Controlled. Deliberate. Every touch calculated to undo me piece by piece.

And it's working.

I've always been in control. Always. Control is survival. Control is power. Control is the difference between living and dying in our world.

But here, now, with him—

I don't want control.

I want to fall.

And I do.

His name tears from my throat, raw and unguarded, as the world shatters white-hot around me. I cling to him, nails digging crescents into his shoulders, anchoring myself to the only solid thing in a reality that's dissolved into pure sensation.

He follows seconds later, my name on his lips, body taut and trembling, undone in the same way I am.

Perfect.

Devastating.

*Ours.*

---

### DANTE

We lie tangled together afterward, breathing hard, hearts still racing.

Her head rests on my chest. My fingers trace idle patterns on her shoulder, mindless and soothing, something I've never done with anyone else and can't seem to stop doing with her.

**"We really should sleep,"** she murmurs.

**"We should."**

**"Tomorrow's going to be dangerous."**

**"Every day is dangerous."**

**"Fair point."**

Silence settles. Comfortable. Safe.

I press a kiss to the top of her head, breathing in the scent of her—sweat and perfume and something uniquely *her*.

**"Vivienne?"**

**"Mm?"**

**"I—"**

The words stick. I don't know how to finish that sentence. Don't know what I'm trying to say.

*I need you. I trust you. I'm terrified of how much you matter.*

All of it. None of it.

She tilts her head, looks up at me with those sharp, knowing eyes.

**"I know,"** she says softly.

And somehow, that's enough.

I pull her closer. She settles against me, body fitting perfectly into the spaces I didn't know were empty.

We fall asleep like that.

Together.

Tangled.

Safe.

For now.

---

## CHAPTER 4: THE BETRAYAL

### DANTE

There's a soft, irregular sound outside the bedroom. Wood settling. Footsteps where there shouldn't be any.

I wake slowly.

Vivienne is asleep beside me, bare skin warm against the sheets, her breathing steady, unguarded in a way she never allows herself when conscious. I watch her for a moment longer than necessary. Then, carefully, I adjust the blanket, covering her, making sure she's comfortable. A small, almost human gesture.

I pull on my boxers and slip out of the room.

The hallway is dim, quiet.

Sera is already there.

Waiting.

She knew it would be me who stepped out, not Vivienne.

She's covered in blood again.

Fresh. Still wet. Still warm. None of it hers.

**"We have a problem,"** she says.

No panic. No urgency. Just a statement of fact.

She turns and walks, and I follow her down into the basement. The air shifts as we descend, colder, heavier, as if the house itself is aware of what's being kept below. The lights hum overhead. Concrete. Steel. The smell of iron and fear bleeding into everything.

In the center of the room sits Dmitri Rostov's second-in-command.

Tied to a chair. Arms cinched tight. Head slumped forward, unconscious. His face is barely recognizable, swollen and ruined, bruises blooming deep purple and red across bone. Blood streaks his chest where Calabrese family tattoos have been carved directly into his skin, fresh enough to still glisten under the lights.

Sera stands beside him, composed. Detached.

**"He's been working for them longer than Claudia,"** she says. **"I've been tracking him since I got here."** She doesn't look at the man. She doesn't need to. **"Tonight he tried to send a message to the Calabrese family about tomorrow's trap."**

She hands me his phone.

The screen lights up.

An unsent message, blunt and final.

**THEY KNOW. ABORT PHASE 2.**

**"I stopped him,"** Sera says. Then, quieter. Sharper. **"But there's more."**

She swipes and turns the phone toward me.

A photo fills the screen.

Vivienne.

Standing close to a Calabrese lieutenant. Too close. Two weeks before the wedding. Their bodies angled toward each other, familiar in a way that refuses to be explained away no matter how long I stare at it.

**"Either your wife is a traitor,"** Sera says carefully, choosing each word like it might detonate, **"or someone is setting her up."** A pause. **"Either way, her father is going to believe she betrayed the Bratva."**

Silence settles over the room.

No raised voices. No alarms. Just the slow, suffocating pressure of understanding tightening around my chest.

One wrong move, and this doesn't stay buried in the basement.

It becomes a war.

Between families.
Between blood.

The question isn't whether someone dies.

It's how many.

I stare at the photo. Study it. Force myself to see past the immediate gut reaction, past the jealousy and rage and betrayal clawing at my ribcage.

Details.

The lighting—late afternoon, natural. The location—looks like a park, neutral territory. Vivienne's posture—tense, not relaxed. The lieutenant's body language—aggressive, leaning in.

This isn't a lover's meeting.

This is a confrontation.

**"When exactly was this taken?"** I ask.

Sera checks the metadata. **"Fifteen days before the wedding. 4:47 PM."**

I do the math.

The timing clicks into place with a sick, precise certainty.

It was the same day Vivienne’s extraction team was ambushed in Brooklyn. Three of her people died that night. Experienced. Loyal. Gone. She came home furious, drenched in blood that wasn’t hers, violence still clinging to her like a second skin.

After that, she locked herself inside her father’s study for six hours.

No witnesses. No explanations.

At least, that’s what my intelligence reports say.

This photo was taken hours before that ambush.

**"She was investigating,"** I say slowly. **"Someone tipped off the Calabrese family about her team's location. She was hunting for the leak."**

**"Or,"** Sera counters, **"she IS the leak, and this was her getting paid."**

**"No."**

The certainty in my voice surprises even me.

**"You're sure?"** Sera asks.

Am I?

I've known Vivienne for barely two days as my wife. Known her for months before that as an enemy, a rival, a dangerous unknown.

But last night—tonight—the way she looked at me, the way she trusted me, the way she *chose* me—

That wasn't a lie.

I know what lying looks like. I've built a career on recognizing deception.

And Vivienne wasn't lying.

**"I'm sure,"** I say. **"This is a setup. Someone's trying to drive a wedge between our families. Between us."**

**"Then we need proof,"** Sera says. **"Real proof. Before her father sees this photo."**

She's right.

If Dmitri sees this without context, without explanation, he'll assume the worst. He'll think his daughter betrayed the Bratva. And then—

War.

Internal. Bloody. The kind that destroys families from the inside out.

**"Wake him up,"** I tell Sera, gesturing at the unconscious man. **"I need to know everything. Who he's working for, who else is compromised, and who the fuck took this photo."**

Sera nods and moves toward a table I deliberately don't look at too closely. Metal instruments. Chemical bottles. Tools designed for one purpose: extracting truth from people who don't want to give it.

**"Should I get Vivienne?"** she asks.

I hesitate.

Does Vivienne have an explanation?

Or is this something else entirely?

I know where her loyalty lies. It's in her blood. In her family. In the world that shaped her. But loyalty to *me*?

We've been married for two nights.

Was it real? Or just another calculated role she plays flawlessly?

The doubt tastes like poison.

I hate it.

But I can't ignore it.

**"Not yet,"** I say. **"Let me handle this first. Get him talking. Find out what he knows."**

**"And if he confirms she's a traitor?"**

I meet Sera's eyes. Cold. Absolute.

**"He won't,"** I say. **"Because she's not."**

Sera studies me for a long moment. Then nods.

**"Okay. I believe you."**

**"Why?"**

**"Because you're either right, or you're about to do something incredibly stupid for love."** She picks up a syringe filled with something clear and vicious. **"Either way, it'll be interesting to watch."**

She's insane.

And she's probably right.

She approaches the bound man, taps the syringe, and injects it directly into his neck. He jerks awake with a strangled gasp, eyes wild, disoriented, pain flooding his system as consciousness returns with brutal efficiency.

**"Good morning,"** Sera says pleasantly. **"Let's talk about who you work for."**

---

### DANTE

The man's eyes snap open, wild and unfocused, trying to orient himself through the haze of pain and whatever chemical cocktail Sera just pumped into his veins. His name is Viktor Sokolov. Dmitri's second-in-command for the last eight years. A man I've sat across from at negotiation tables, shared whiskey with, trusted with strategic intelligence.

A man who's been selling us out to the Calabreses the entire time.

Rage coils in my gut, cold and patient. I let it settle. I'll need it later.

Viktor's gaze lands on me, and recognition flickers through the pain. Fear follows immediately after.

Good.

**"Dante,"** he rasps. **"This is... this isn't what it looks like—"**

**"It looks like you're tied to a chair in my basement with Calabrese tattoos carved into your chest,"** I say evenly. **"What exactly should it look like?"**

His mouth works. No sound comes out.

Sera moves behind him, silent as smoke, and produces a pair of pliers from the table. She doesn't threaten. Doesn't speak. Just lets him see the tool, lets his imagination fill in the blanks.

**"I didn't have a choice,"** Viktor says, words tumbling out fast and desperate. **"They have my daughter. They took her three years ago. Said if I didn't cooperate, they'd send her back to me in pieces."**

**"Your daughter died in a car accident,"** I counter. **"Five years ago. I was at the funeral."**

His face crumples.

**"Try again,"** Sera suggests, and her tone is almost kind. Almost.

**"How much did they pay you?"** I ask.

Silence.

Sera doesn't wait. She grabs his left hand, pins it flat against the armrest, and positions the pliers around his pinky finger.

**"Wait! Wait—"** Viktor's voice cracks. **"Five million. Over three years. It started small. Just information. Meeting locations. Personnel movements. Then they wanted more."**

**"The photo,"** I say. **"Of Vivienne meeting with the Calabrese lieutenant. Who took it?"**

**"I don't know his name. They sent someone. Professional. He's been shadowing both families for months."**

**"Why?"**

**"To build leverage. To create chaos. To—"** He stops, realizes he's said too much.

**"To what?"** Sera prompts, applying gentle pressure. Not enough to break. Not yet. Just enough to promise.

**"To destroy the alliance,"** Viktor gasps. **"They want you and Vivienne to turn on each other. Want the families at war. Want everything to collapse from the inside."**

I process this. It tracks. The cathedral attack was too coordinated. Too well-informed. And now this—evidence designed to make me doubt my wife, to fracture the one thing holding this fragile peace together.

**"Who's running the operation?"** I ask.

**"I don't know. I swear. I only ever dealt with intermediaries. They're careful. Paranoid. No paper trails. No direct contact."**

**"The photo,"** I press. **"What's the context? What was Vivienne actually doing?"**

Viktor hesitates.

Sera twists the pliers. Just a fraction.

He screams.

**"She was investigating!"** he shouts. **"She suspected a leak after Brooklyn. She tracked the lieutenant to that park. Confronted him. Threatened him."** A breath. Ragged. **"The Calabreses killed him two days later. Made it look like a mugging. They couldn't risk her finding out more."**

Relief floods through me, sharp and immediate.

I was right.

Vivienne wasn't betraying anyone. She was hunting the betrayal.

And someone photographed it, saved it, weaponized it to be used exactly like this.

**"Who else knows about this photo?"** I ask.

**"Just me. And the photographer. They wanted me to leak it to Dmitri tomorrow. After the dinner. After the trap was sprung. Maximum chaos."**

**"Where's the photographer now?"**

**"I don't know. They move him around. Different locations. Different identities."**

I study Viktor. Broken. Desperate. Useful.

And completely expendable.

**"One more question,"** I say quietly. **"Did you know about the cathedral attack beforehand?"**

His silence is answer enough.

**"How many?"** Sera asks, voice soft as silk. **"How many people died because you sold us out?"**

**"I didn't want—"**

**"HOW MANY?"**

**"Forty-three,"** he whispers. **"Over three years. Forty-three operations compromised. Forty-three people dead because of information I gave them."**

The number hangs in the air like smoke.

Forty-three lives.

Forty-three families destroyed.

All for five million dollars and a loyalty that never existed.

I should feel rage. Fury. The urge to make him suffer the way those forty-three people suffered.

But all I feel is cold. Clinical. Final.

**"Sera,"** I say. **"Get everything he knows. Names. Accounts. Contact protocols. Every detail."**

**"And then?"**

**"And then make it clean. He doesn't suffer. He just stops."**

Viktor's eyes go wide. **"Dante, please—"**

**"You chose this,"** I tell him. **"The moment you took their money. The moment you sold out your people. This is just the consequence."**

I turn to leave.

**"Wait!"** Viktor shouts. **"There's more! There's something else!"**

I stop. Don't turn around.

**"The Silent Court,"** he gasps. **"They're involved. The Calabreses aren't running this alone. They're working with the Court. This is bigger than mob wars. Bigger than families. This is—"**

Footsteps on the stairs.

Soft. Familiar.

Vivienne.

She descends into the basement wearing nothing but my shirt from last night, bare legs, hair still mussed from sleep. She should look vulnerable. Civilian. Out of place in this concrete tomb of blood and interrogation.

She doesn't.

She looks like she owns the room.

Her eyes scan the scene. Viktor tied and broken. Sera with bloodied pliers. Me standing between them like a judge at sentencing.

**"Well,"** she says calmly. **"This is an interesting way to wake up."**

---

### VIVIENNE

I’m not stupid.

The moment I woke up and Dante was gone, I knew something was wrong. The house carried that particular kind of silence, the kind that doesn’t mean peace but aftermath. Violence had already happened. It was simply waiting to continue.

I followed the absence of sound down into the basement.

And found this.

Viktor Sokolov.

My father’s most trusted lieutenant. The man who trained me in combat tactics when I was fifteen. The man who held my mother’s hand while she was dying, steady and silent when the rest of the world fell apart.

He’s tied to a chair now. Broken. Tortured. Calabrese markings carved into his skin like a confession written in blood.

Traitor.

The betrayal should hurt.

It doesn’t.

I learned a long time ago not to expect loyalty from anyone who isn’t looking me directly in the eyes when they swear it.

**"Vivienne,"** Dante starts, and there's something careful in his voice. **"We need to talk about—"**

**"The photo,"** I finish. **"Of me and the Calabrese lieutenant."**

His expression shifts. Surprise. Relief. Guilt.

**"You know about it?"**

**"I'm going to assume Viktor showed it to you. Or Sera did."** I walk closer, bare feet silent on cold concrete. **"I'm also going to assume you had a moment of doubt. Wondered if I was playing you. Wondered if the marriage was just another move on a board you couldn't see."**

**"Vivienne—"**

**"It's fine,"** I say, and mean it. **"We've known each other for three days as a couple. Two days as spouses. Doubt is reasonable. Doubt is smart."** I stop in front of Viktor, look down at him with clinical detachment. **"But for the record, I wasn't betraying anyone. I was hunting whoever killed my team in Brooklyn."**

**"I know,"** Dante says. **"Viktor confirmed it."**

I look at my husband. Really look at him this time.

Not the weapon. Not the heir. Not the man built from violence and expectation.

Him.

He believed me. Before Viktor said a word. Before confirmation. Before truth was convenient or safe. Even with evidence laid out in front of him, sharp and damning, he chose trust over doubt.

He chose me.

That choice isn’t small. It isn’t sentimental. It’s dangerous.

In our world, it means something.

It means everything.

**"Thank you,"** I tell him quietly.

**"For what?"**

**"For not shooting me first and asking questions later."**

**"The thought crossed my mind,"** he admits.

**"I'd have been disappointed if it hadn't."**

Sera watches us with fascination, like we're a science experiment she's documenting for future reference.

I turn my attention to Viktor.

**"How long?"** I ask him.

He knows what I'm asking.

**"Three years."**

**"My mother?"**

His silence is answer enough.

Cold fury crystallizes in my chest. My mother died three years ago. Cancer, they said. Aggressive. Untreatable.

But in our world, cancer is sometimes induced. Sometimes accelerated. Sometimes weaponized.

**"Did you know?"** I ask, voice very quiet. Very controlled.

**"I suspected,"** Viktor whispers. **"After. But I couldn't prove—"**

I hit him.

Fast. Precise. Not a slap. A punch. Knuckles to jaw. The kind that breaks teeth and rattles brains.

His head snaps sideways. Blood sprays.

**"My mother TRUSTED you,"** I say, and my voice doesn't shake. Doesn't break. It just exists. Cold. Final. **"She called you family."**

**"I'm sorry—"**

**"You will be."**

I look at Sera. **"What did Dante tell you to do with him?"**

**"Get information. Then make it clean."**

**"Change of plans,"** I say. **"Get the information. Then make it slow."**

Dante doesn't argue. Doesn't question.

He just nods.

Because he understands.

Some betrayals don't deserve mercy.

**"Vivienne, please—"** Viktor starts.

**"You said something about the Silent Court,"** I interrupt, ignoring his plea entirely. **"Explain."**

He's crying now. Broken. **"They're funding the Calabreses. Providing intelligence. Resources. They want the families at war. Want the old structures destroyed. Want to rebuild everything under their control."**

**"Why?"**

**"Power. Always power. The families control too much. Too much territory. Too much loyalty. The Court wants to centralize. Wants to be the only game in town."**

I exchange a glance with Dante.

This changes everything.

The Cathedral attack wasn't just a Calabrese power play. It was an opening move in a much larger game. And we're not players—we're pieces being moved by hands we can't see.

**"Do you have proof?"** Dante asks.

**"Phone,"** Viktor gasps. **"Hidden in my apartment. Under the floorboards. Master bedroom. Southwest corner. Everything's there. Financial records. Communications. Orders."**

**"If you're lying—"** I start.

**"I'm not. I swear. I'm dead anyway. Why would I lie?"**

Fair point.

**"Sera,"** Dante says. **"Send someone to retrieve it. Discreetly."**

She nods and pulls out her phone, starts typing.

I crouch down in front of Viktor so we're eye level.

**"My mother's cancer,"** I say softly. **"Who ordered it?"**

**"I don't know. I wasn't that high up the chain. I just... I suspected the timing. That's all."**

I believe him.

Unfortunately.

**"One more question,"** I tell him. **"The photographer. The one who's been shadowing us. Where would he be now?"**

**"Close,"** Viktor says. **"He always stays close to his subjects. Probably within a mile of this house. Watching. Documenting."**

My skin crawls.

Someone's been watching us. In our home. In our bedroom. Capturing evidence for use against us.

**"How do we find him?"**

**"You don't. He finds you when he's ready to strike."**

Not helpful.

I stand, brush imaginary dust off my thighs.

**"Sera,"** I say. **"He's yours. Do what you do best."**

**"Wait!"** Viktor shouts. **"There's one more thing! About the dinner tomorrow! They're not just planning to kill your fathers—they're planning to frame YOU for it! Both of you! Make it look like a coup! Turn the entire underworld against you!"**

Dante and I freeze.

**"Explain,"** he demands.

**"The guns they're bringing. They're registered to you. To Vivienne. The bullets match weapons you own. The evidence trail leads directly back to both of you. When your fathers die, everyone will think you killed them to seize power."**

**"Who planned this?"** I ask.

**"The Court. Through the Calabreses. It's supposed to look like natural succession gone wrong. Like you two got greedy. Impatient."**

I look at Dante.

He looks at me.

We're thinking the same thing.

*Checkmate in three moves.*

Unless we flip the board.

**"How many people know about this plan?"** Dante asks.

**"Everyone involved. Maybe twenty operatives. Plus whoever's running things from the Court."**

**"And if we kill them all tomorrow at the dinner?"** I ask. **"Before they can execute?"**

**"You'd still be blamed. The evidence is already planted. The narrative is already written. Even if you survive, you lose."**

Dante's jaw tightens.

This is sophisticated. Layered. Every angle covered.

We can't just fight our way out of this one.

We need to think.

**"Sera,"** Dante says. **"Continue the interrogation. Get everything. Every detail. Every name. Every contingency."**

**"And then?"**

**"Then you know what to do."**

She smiles. Sharp. Anticipating.

Viktor starts begging.

We ignore him and head back upstairs.

---

### DANTE

Back in the main house, Vivienne and I stand in the kitchen as dawn starts bleeding through the windows. Neither of us speaks for a long moment.

**"So,"** she finally says. **"The Silent Court is real. They're trying to destroy us. And they've spent three years setting up an elaborate trap that culminates tomorrow at a dinner designed to murder our fathers and frame us for it."**

**"That about sums it up,"** I agree.

**"Cool. Cool cool cool."** She pours coffee. Hands me a cup. **"We should probably call off the dinner."**

**"Can't. They'll just try again. And next time we won't know it's coming."**

**"So we spring their trap on purpose."**

**"Yes."**

**"And somehow flip it so they're the ones who end up dead."**

**"Exactly."**

She sips her coffee. Thinking.

**"We'll need help,"** she says. **"People we trust absolutely. No room for more moles."**

**"Sera."**

**"Obviously Sera."**

**"Your father's network. My father's people. But only the ones we've personally vetted."**

**"That's maybe ten people total."**

**"Against twenty operatives plus whatever the Court sends as backup."**

**"Bad odds."**

**"Terrible odds."**

**"I love terrible odds,"** she says, and means it.

I laugh despite everything. Because of course she does.

**"We need to warn our fathers,"** I say. **"Without tipping off anyone else."**

**"Agreed. But carefully. Your father might try to cancel. Mine will definitely want to go nuclear."**

**"Let them. But on our terms."**

She nods. Sets down her coffee. Moves closer.

**"Dante."**

**"Vivienne."**

**"If this goes wrong tomorrow—"**

**"It won't."**

**"But if it does,"** she insists. **"If one of us doesn't make it—"**

I cup her face in my hands. Stop the words before they can form.

**"We both make it,"** I tell her. **"Or neither of us does. Those are the only two options."**

**"That's not strategic."**

**"I don't care."**

**"Dante—"**

**"I mean it. We survive together. Or we go down together. I'm not losing you three days after finding you."**

She stares at me. Something vulnerable flickering behind those sharp eyes.

**"You're insane,"** she whispers.

**"You married me."**

**"Clearly a tactical error."**

**"Too late now."**

She kisses me.

Hard. Urgent. Desperate in a way that has nothing to do with hunger and everything to do with memory. Like she’s trying to carve the taste of me into herself, to make sure it survives even if tomorrow doesn’t.

For a moment, the world narrows to that single point of contact. Breath. Heat. The unspoken understanding that neither of us is promised anything beyond the next sunrise.

When she pulls back, her eyes are dry.

Steady.

Burning with a resolve that doesn’t need tears to prove it.

**"Okay,"** she says. **"Let's go plan a counter-massacre."**

**"That's my girl."**

We spend the next three hours sealed inside Dante’s study. Doors locked. Phones powered down. The outside world reduced to a liability.

We build a plan the way surgeons work, precise, ruthless, aware that even a millimeter of error means death. Every variable accounted for. Every contingency layered on top of another. Timing measured in seconds. Trust measured in blood.

By the time Sera finally emerges from the basement, her clothes smeared dark and her expression quietly satisfied, we already feel the shape of it taking form. She drops a USB drive onto the desk. Inside it is everything Viktor knew before he stopped knowing anything at all.

Names. Channels. Weak points. The anatomy of a betrayal laid bare.

It isn’t a guarantee.

But it’s a chance.

And in our world, that’s all you ever get.

---

### VIVIENNE

8:47 a.m.

I’m back in the bedroom, getting dressed.

Tactical gear masquerading as elegance. Kevlar threaded invisibly into fabric that costs more than most people’s cars. Weapons hidden where designers never meant for steel or gunmetal to rest, seams and silhouettes repurposed for violence.

Luxury, weaponized.

I move with practiced efficiency, each adjustment deliberate, muscle memory taking over where thought isn’t needed. There’s no hesitation. No nerves. Just preparation.

Dante stands in the doorway, watching.

Not intruding. Not speaking.

Just there.

**"You look lethal,"** he observes.

**"That's the idea."**

**"I like it."**

**"I know you do."**

He crosses the room and pulls me into him.

The motion is firm, instinctive, like he’s claiming something that’s already his. For just a moment, I let myself lean into it. Let the armor slip. Let the world narrow to the solid warmth of his body, the steady certainty of his arms.

I allow myself to feel small.

Protected.

It’s a luxury I almost never permit. A weakness I usually crush before it can take root. But here, in this brief, stolen second, I let it exist. Then it’s gone, folded back into steel and resolve, exactly where it belongs.

**"We're going to survive this,"** he says. Not a question. A command.

**"Yes,"** I agree. **"We are."**

Because the alternative is unacceptable.

We’ve built something here. Fragile. Bloodstained. Probably doomed from the start, stitched together with violence and choice and defiance. But it’s ours.

And I will burn the entire underworld to ash before I let anyone take it from me.

**"Ready?"** Dante asks.

**"Always."**

We head downstairs together.

Sera is waiting in the living room, cleaned up, armed to the teeth, looking like a very dangerous child playing dress-up with adult weapons.

**"Viktor talk?"** I ask.

**"Extensively,"** she confirms. **"Before the end."**

**"Good."**

**"Also,"** Sera adds, pulling out her phone, **"I found something interesting in his records. A name that keeps appearing. Someone high up in the Court's hierarchy."**

**"Who?"** Dante asks.

She turns the phone toward us.

The name on the screen makes my blood run cold.

**Senator Richard Calloway.**

The same senator the Court mentioned in their recruitment letter. The one they wanted us to assassinate as a "test."

**"He's not just connected to the Court,"** Sera explains. **"He IS the Court. Or at least one of the three leaders. He's been funding the Calabrese operations. Providing political cover. Making evidence disappear."**

Dante's expression hardens.

**"So the assassination request wasn't a test,"** he says slowly. **"It was them cleaning up a loose end. Using us as disposable tools."**

**"And if we refused,"** I continue, **"they'd make sure our war with the Calabreses never ended. Keep us distracted and dying while they consolidated power."**

**"Exactly."**

We fall silent for a moment, the weight of it settling in.

The Silent Court isn’t just another criminal organization. It isn’t a rival family or a syndicate you can cut the head off and watch collapse. It’s a shadow government. Politicians. Judges. Law enforcement. All of them woven together, hands clean in public, filthy beneath the surface, controlling the underworld from above with laws and favors instead of guns.

And somehow, against all odds and sense,

we just became their primary target.

**"Change of plans,"** Dante says. **"We don't just survive tomorrow. We win. Completely. Utterly. We destroy the Calabrese operation, expose the Court's involvement, and make sure everyone knows what happens when they come after us."**

**"That's ambitious,"** I observe.

**"You have a better idea?"**

**"No. I love it. Let's burn it all down."**

Sera grins. **"Now you're talking my language."**

My phone buzzes.

My father. An immediate meeting requested. No pleasantries. No explanation.

A second later, Dante’s phone rings.

His father. Same request.

Same timing.

Same urgency.

They know something’s wrong.

**"Time to brief the patriarchs,"** I say.

**"This should be fun,"** Dante mutters.

We leave together.

Sera follows a step behind us, quiet, watchful, lethal in the way shadows are lethal when they move on their own terms.

Tomorrow, we face the trap.

But today?

Today, we make damn sure we aren’t the ones who get caught in it.

**TO BE CONTINUED...**
## CHAPTER 5: THE SILENT COURT

### DANTE

The drive to my father''s estate takes twenty minutes.

Twenty minutes of silence, tension coiled tight in the air between us. Vivienne sits beside me in the back seat, posture perfect, expression unreadable. To anyone watching, she looks calm. Composed. In control.

I know better.

I can see it in the way her fingers tap against her thighrhythmic, measured, the same pattern she uses when she''s calculating trajectories and kill counts. She''s running scenarios. Planning contingencies. Preparing for every possible outcome of the conversation we''re about to have.

Sera drives. She insisted. Said she wanted to "get familiar with defensive driving protocols." What she really wanted was control of the vehicle in case we need to make a very fast, very violent exit.

Smart kid.

Terrifying kid.

Our kid now, apparently.

**"Your father''s going to be difficult,"** Vivienne says quietly. Not a question. A statement.

**"He''s going to want to cancel the dinner. Go to war immediately. Scorched earth."**

**"Mine will want the same."**

**"We can''t let them."**

**"I know."**

She turns to look at me properly. **"We''re asking them to walk into an assassination attempt. To trust that we can flip it. That''s... a lot."**

**"They trusted us enough to arrange this marriage."**

**"That was strategy. This is faith."**

She''s right. This is different.

This is asking two men who''ve built empires on paranoia and controlled violence to voluntarily put their heads in a noose and trust that their childrentheir psychopath children who''ve been married for three dayscan cut the rope before it tightens.

**"They''ll do it,"** I say with more confidence than I feel.

**"How do you know?"**

**"Because the alternative is watching everything they''ve built collapse from the inside while the Silent Court picks through the wreckage."**

**"And if they refuse?"**

**"Then we do it anyway. Without them."**

She smiles. Small. Dangerous. Satisfied.

**"I was hoping you''d say that."**

We pull through the gates of my father''s compound. Armed guards everywhere. More than usual. He knows something''s wrong.

As we step out of the car, I see my father waiting at the entrance. Lorenzo Morelli. Sixty-three years old. Silver hair. Sharp eyes that miss nothing. A man who''s survived four decades in this life through a combination of strategic brilliance and the willingness to do absolutely anything to protect what''s his.

He''s not alone.

Dmitri Rostov stands beside him. Vivienne''s father. Taller. Broader. A bull where Lorenzo is a fox. But equally dangerous. Equally calculating.

Both men study us as we approach.

They''re reading us. Looking for tells. For weaknesses. For deception.

They find none.

Because we''re not hiding anything.

Not from them.

Not anymore.

**"Inside,"** Lorenzo says. Not a request.

We follow them into his study. The door closes. Locks. The room is swept for bugs daily. Triple-reinforced walls. No windows. A bunker disguised as an office.

The safest place to have the most dangerous conversation.

Lorenzo moves to his desk. Dmitri takes position near the fireplace. Classic power positioning. They''re presenting a united front.

Good.

We''ll need it.

**"Talk,"** Dmitri orders, looking at his daughter.

Vivienne doesn''t flinch. Doesn''t hesitate.

**"Viktor Sokolov was a traitor,"** she says flatly. **"Sold out to the Calabreses three years ago. He''s dead now."**

Dmitri''s expression doesn''t change. But I see his hand tighten around his glass. Viktor was his second-in-command. A trusted advisor. A friend.

**"Proof?"** he asks, voice dangerously quiet.

Sera steps forward, offers a tablet. **"Full confession. Financial records. Communication logs. Everything."**

Dmitri takes it. Reads. His face hardens with every line.

Lorenzo looks at me. **"This is why you called this meeting?"**

**"Partially,"** I admit. **"Viktor gave us intelligence before he died. About tomorrow''s dinner."**

**"What about it?"**

**"It''s a trap. The Calabrese family plans to assassinate both of you. And frame Vivienne and me for it."**

Silence.

Heavy. Absolute.

Then Lorenzo laughs.

Not amused. Dark. The laugh of a man who''s seen every trick and isn''t surprised anymore.

**"Of course they do,"** he says. **"Ambitious. Stupid. But ambitious."**

**"It''s worse than that,"** Vivienne says. **"They''re not working alone."**

She takes the tablet from her father, swipes to a new file, and turns it toward both patriarchs.

**"The Silent Court,"** she says. **"Have you heard of them?"**

The room temperature drops about ten degrees.

Lorenzo and Dmitri exchange a look. Long. Weighted. Full of history I don''t understand.

**"Yes,"** Lorenzo says finally. **"We''ve heard of them."**

**"What do you know?"** I ask.

My father moves to the bar, pours four glasses of whiskey. Hands them out. Takes a long drink before speaking.

**"Twenty years ago,"** he begins, **"the underworld was chaos. Every family fighting every other family. No structure. No rules. Just violence and territory grabs. It was profitable, but unsustainable."**

Dmitri picks up the thread. **"Then someone started consolidating. Not by force. By offering something better. Protection. Political cover. Access to resources no single family could access alone. In exchange for tribute. For loyalty. For obedience."**

**"The Silent Court,"** I say.

**"The Silent Court,"** Lorenzo confirms. **"Three leaders. Never named publicly. Never photographed. Never caught. They operate through intermediaries. Politicians. Judges. Cops. Legitimate businessmen who provide cover for illegitimate operations."**

**"And you work with them?"** Vivienne asks her father.

**"Work FOR them,"** Dmitri corrects bitterly. **"We all do. Every major family. We pay tribute. We follow rules. In exchange, they keep the law off our backs. Keep the feds distracted. Make problems disappear."**

**"Why didn''t you tell us?"** I demand.

**"Because,"** Lorenzo says, **"the first rule of the Silent Court is that you don''t talk about the Silent Court. To anyone. Not your lieutenants. Not your heirs. Not your wives."** He meets my eyes. **"They''re everywhere, Dante. Embedded in every institution. They hear everything. See everything. And if you step out of line, you disappear."**

**"How many families have disappeared?"** Vivienne asks.

**"Twelve,"** Dmitri says. **"In the last two decades. All of them tried to break away. Tried to operate independently. All of them were systematically destroyed. Assassinations. Federal raids. Asset seizures. Internal betrayals. Until nothing was left."**

I process this. The Silent Court isn''t just another player.

They''re the house.

And we''re betting against the house.

**"Senator Calloway,"** I say. **"He''s one of the three leaders, isn''t he?"**

Lorenzo''s eyebrows rise. **"How did you"**

**"Viktor''s records. They mentioned him repeatedly. High-level communications. Direct orders."**

**"Yes,"** Lorenzo confirms. **"Richard Calloway. United States Senator. Decorated war hero. Philanthropist. Presidential hopeful."** His voice drips sarcasm. **"And one third of the most powerful criminal organization in the country."**

**"Who are the other two?"** Vivienne asks.

**"We don''t know,"** Dmitri admits. **"Calloway is the political face. The one who operates in the light. The other two stay in shadow. We''ve never been able to identify them."**

**"But,"** Lorenzo adds, **"we know what they control. One runs operationscoordination between families, strategic planning, resource allocation. The other handles enforcementeliminating threats, maintaining discipline, making sure no one steps out of line."**

**"And they want us dead,"** I say. **"Why?"**

**"Because you''re dangerous,"** my father says simply. **"This marriagethis alliance between the Morellis and the Bratvait represents something they can''t control. A unified power base that''s too strong to manipulate. Too loyal to infiltrate. Too smart to be fooled by their usual tactics."**

**"They wanted us to fight each other,"** Vivienne realizes. **"That''s why they supported the Calabrese family. Why they''ve been feeding them intelligence and resources. They wanted to keep our families at war."**

**"Exactly,"** Dmitri confirms. **"As long as we were enemies, we were predictable. Manageable. But now"**

**"Now we''re married,"** I finish. **"United. Unpredictable. A threat to their entire power structure."**

**"So they''re going to kill you,"** Lorenzo says. **"Both of you. And your fathers. Wipe out the leadership of both families. Install puppet successors who''ll do what they''re told. Return things to the status quo."**

**"They''re going to try,"** Vivienne corrects. **"There''s a difference."**

Dmitri studies his daughter. Really looks at her. And I see something shift in his expression. Recognition. Pride. Fear.

**"You have a plan,"** he says.

**"We have a plan,"** she confirms.

**"Tell us."**

For the next hour, we lay it all out.

The trap. The counter-trap. The evidence we''ve gathered. The weaknesses we''ve identified. The allies we''ve secured. The backup contingencies we''ve prepared.

It''s ambitious.

It''s dangerous.

It''s absolutely insane.

And by the end, both patriarchs are smiling.



---

### VIVIENNE

**"You want us to be bait,"** my father says when we finish. Not accusatory. Appreciative.

**"We want you to be survivors,"** I correct. **"The bait is just the method."**

**"Twenty operatives,"** Lorenzo muses. **"Against what? Ten of us?"**

**"Twelve if you include us,"** Dante says.

**"Fourteen if you include me and Sera,"** I add.

**"A fifteen-year-old child?"** Dmitri asks skeptically.

**"A fifteen-year-old child who tortured Viktor Sokolov for three hours, extracted every piece of intelligence he had, and killed him so efficiently that forensics won't be able to identify the body,"** Dante says flatly. **"She's more than qualified."**

My father looks at Sera properly for the first time. Really sees her.

She stares back. Unflinching. A predator recognizing another predator.

**"I like her,"** Dmitri decides.

**"Everyone does,"** I mutter.

**"The evidence,"** Lorenzo says, bringing us back on track. **"The planted weapons. The financial trails. How do we counter that?"**

**"We don't,"** Dante says. **"We use it."**

He pulls out another file. Spreads documents across the desk.

**"Every piece of evidence they've planted leads back to us, yes. But evidence can be recontextualized. We make it look like WE discovered the plot. That we were investigating. That we were trying to prevent the assassination."**

**"They're using weapons registered to you?"** Lorenzo asks.

**"So we report them stolen. File police reports. Create a paper trail showing we discovered the theft weeks ago."**

**"The financial records?"**

**"We reverse-engineer them. Show that we were tracking Calabrese payments. Building a case."**

**"They'll claim you're lying,"** Dmitri points out.

**"They can claim whatever they want,"** I say. **"Dead men can't testify."**

The room goes quiet.

**"You're planning to kill them all,"** my father says. Not a question. A realization.

**"Every single operative,"** I confirm. **"Every Calabrese soldier. Everyone the Court sends. We turn the dinner into a massacre. Their massacre. Not ours."**

**"And the Silent Court?"** Lorenzo asks. **"You think they'll just accept that? Let it go?"**

**"No,"** Dante says. **"Which is why we're not stopping at the dinner."**

He pulls out one more file. This one thicker. Heavier.

**"Viktor gave us everything. Names. Accounts. Operations. But more importantly—he gave us leverage. Evidence of the Court's involvement in sixteen different federal crimes. Recordings of Calloway ordering assassinations. Financial records tying him to drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, human trafficking."**

**"Mutually assured destruction,"** I add. **"We survive tomorrow. Then we approach the Court. Not as victims. As equals. We tell them: Leave us alone, or we release everything. Destroy your entire operation. Burn it all down."**

**"They'll kill you,"** Dmitri says.

**"They'll try,"** I correct. **"But we'll have dead man's switches. Multiple copies of the evidence with trusted parties. Instructions to release everything if anything happens to us."**

**"You're declaring war on the most powerful criminal organization in the country,"** Lorenzo says. **"That's suicide."**

**"No,"** Dante counters. **"We're negotiating from a position of strength. They want control. We're offering them a choice: control without us, or chaos if they push."**

**"And you think they'll choose control?"**

**"They're criminals,"** I say. **"But they're businessmen first. They'll make the rational choice."**

Silence again.

Longer this time.

Lorenzo and Dmitri look at each other. Another one of those weighted looks. Decades of history. Trust built through blood and violence.

Finally, my father speaks.

**"This is insane."**

**"Yes,"** I agree.

**"We could all die tomorrow."**

**"Yes."**

**"The Court could decide to make an example of us regardless."**

**"Yes."**

He smiles. Slow. Dangerous. The same smile I see in the mirror.

**"I'm in."**

Lorenzo laughs. **"Of course you are, you crazy Russian bastard."** He looks at Dante. At me. **"You're my son. And you're my daughter-in-law now. If you're going to war, we go together."**

**"Family,"** Dmitri agrees, raising his glass.

**"Family,"** we echo.

We drink.

And in that moment, the alliance becomes something more.

Not just a strategy.

Not just a marriage of convenience.

But an actual, honest-to-god family.

Broken. Bloodstained. Psychopathic.

But ours.

We spend the next six hours planning.

Not just tactics. Logistics. Every detail. Every contingency. Every backup plan and fallback position.

We identify our twelve trusted people. Verify their loyalty personally. Bring them in one at a time. Brief them individually. Give each person one piece of the puzzle so no one except the four of us knows the complete picture.

Paranoid?

Absolutely.

Necessary?

Without question.

By afternoon, we have something that resembles a plan. Not perfect. Too many variables. Too much that could go wrong.

But workable.

Maybe.

**"The photographer,"** Vivienne says as we're wrapping up. **"The one who's been watching us. He's still out there."**

**"Viktor said he stays close to his subjects,"** I recall.

**"Within a mile of our house."**

**"We should find him,"** Sera suggests. **"Before tomorrow. Eliminate the variable."**

**"Agreed,"** I say. **"But how? We don't know what he looks like. Don't know where specifically he's set up."**

**"We draw him out,"** Vivienne says. She's got that look. The one that means she's three steps ahead and enjoying it.

**"How?"**

**"We give him something to photograph. Something he can't resist. Something that makes him expose his position."**

I catch on immediately. **"We stage a fight."**

**"Exactly. Outside. Visible. Loud enough that he thinks he's witnessing a breakdown in the alliance. He'll move in closer. Try to capture it. Document the 'proof' that we're falling apart."**

**"And when he does—"** Sera starts.

**"We triangulate his position and put him down,"** Vivienne finishes.

**"I like it,"** Lorenzo says. **"Simple. Direct. Violent."**

**"When?"** Dmitri asks.

**"Tonight,"** I say. **"After dark. Give him the cover of darkness to feel safe."**

**"And if he doesn't take the bait?"**

**"Then tomorrow gets more complicated,"** Vivienne admits. **"But he will. He's been following us for months. He's invested. He'll want the money shot."**

We finalize the details.

By sunset, we're ready.

Ready as we'll ever be, anyway.

### VIVIENNE

9:47 PM.

Dante and I stand in the driveway of our estate. Spotlights illuminating us. Positioned perfectly to be visible from multiple angles.

Sera is hidden on the roof with a thermal scope, scanning for heat signatures within a one-mile radius.

Four of our most trusted people are positioned at cardinal points, ready to move the moment we have a location.

Now we just need to sell it.

**"You sure about this?"** Dante asks quietly.

**"Not even a little bit,"** I admit.

**"Good. Me neither."**

He takes a breath. Then his entire demeanor changes.

Gone is the careful control. The measured responses. The strategic calm.

In its place: rage.

**"I don't care what your father says!"** he shouts, loud enough to carry. **"Viktor was YOUR second-in-command! YOUR responsibility! And he sold us out!"**

**"Don't you dare—"** I yell back, matching his volume. **"Don't you DARE blame this on me! He passed every security check! Every verification!"**

**"Then your security is shit!"**

**"MY security kept YOU alive at the cathedral!"**

**"Barely!"**

We're circling each other now. Body language aggressive. Hostile. Every inch the picture of a marriage falling apart under pressure.

**"Maybe this was a mistake,"** I spit. **"This alliance. This marriage. All of it."**

**"First smart thing you've said all day."**

**"Fuck you, Dante."**

**"You already did. Didn't solve anything."**

Low blow.

I let fury flash across my face. Real fury, even though it's not directed at him. Channel it. Use it.

**"I'm calling my father,"** I announce. **"This is over."**

**"Do it,"** he challenges. **"See if I care."**

I turn my back on him. Pull out my phone.

And that's when I hear it.

The softest sound. Barely perceptible.

A camera shutter. Professional. Expensive. With a silencer to muffle the mechanical click.

But not silent enough.

Northwest. Maybe two hundred yards. Elevated position.

Sera's voice comes through the earpiece we're both wearing. **"Got him. Northwest. Bell tower of the abandoned church. Second floor. Single heat signature. He's moving. Repositioning for a better angle."**

**"Converge,"** Dante says quietly into his own mic. **"Non-lethal if possible. We want him alive."**

Our four people move. Silent. Trained. Deadly.

Dante and I continue the charade for another thirty seconds. Just long enough.

Then we hear it.

A crash. A struggle. A single gunshot—ours, not his.

**"Target secured,"** one of our people reports. **"He's alive. Unconscious. We're bringing him in."**

I let the tension drain from my shoulders. Turn to Dante.

**"Think he got good shots?"** I ask conversationally.

**"I hope so. I really sold that 'fuck you' line."**

**"You really did. Very convincing."**

**"I've been practicing."**

**"It shows."**

We head back inside.

Fifteen minutes later, they bring him in.

Mid-thirties. Unremarkable. The kind of face you'd forget two seconds after seeing it. Professional photographer's gear. Top of the line. Expensive.

And in his bag: a camera with a telephoto lens, a laptop with thousands of photos of us, and an encrypted phone with a single contact labeled "Benefactor."

**"Well well well,"** Sera says, crouching in front of him as he regains consciousness. **"What do we have here?"**

The photographer's eyes open. He sees us all surrounding him. Realizes his situation.

And immediately tries to swallow something.

Dante moves faster. Grabs his jaw. Forces it open. Extracts a false tooth.

Cyanide capsule.

**"No no no,"** Dante says almost gently. **"You don't get the easy way out. We need to talk first."**

**"I won't tell you anything,"** the man says.

**"That's what they all say,"** Sera replies cheerfully. **"Right before they tell us everything."**

She's right.

They always do.

### DANTE

His name is Marcus Webb. Freelance intelligence operative. Formerly CIA. Dishonorably discharged for selling classified information.

Now he sells his services to whoever pays.

In this case: the Silent Court.

It takes Sera twenty minutes to break him.

She's efficient. Clinical. Terrifying in how calmly she escalates.

By the end, we have everything.

**"I was hired six months ago,"** Marcus gasps. **"Before the engagement was even announced. They knew the marriage was coming. Wanted documentation. Evidence. Blackmail material."**

**"Who hired you?"** Vivienne asks.

**"I don't know. Everything was through intermediaries. Encrypted messages. Dead drops for payment."**

**"The contact in your phone,"** I press. **"'Benefactor.' Who is it?"**

**"I don't know! I've never met them! Never heard their voice! Just text messages!"**

**"What were your instructions?"** Vivienne asks.

**"Document everything. Every meeting. Every movement. Create a comprehensive file. Focus on anything that could drive a wedge between the families."**

**"Like the photo of Vivienne and the Calabrese lieutenant."**

**"Yes. That was gold. Perfect angle. Perfect context. Without audio, it looks exactly like a secret meeting."**

**"How many copies?"** I ask.

**"Three. One on my laptop. One uploaded to a secure server. One delivered to my contact."**

**"Where's the server?"**

**"Cloud storage. Encrypted. I can give you the access codes."**

**"And your contact? How do you reach them?"**

**"I don't. They reach me. Only when they want something."**

Dead end.

For now.

**"What else did they want documented?"** Vivienne asks.

Marcus hesitates.

Sera tightens her grip on the pliers she's holding.

**"Everything!"** he shouts. **"Your routines. Your security. Your relationships. They wanted to know every possible weakness. Every point of leverage."**

**"Did they ever mention what they planned to do with it?"**

**"No. Just that it was important. That you two were 'high value targets.' That the Court wanted complete information."**

**"The Court,"** I repeat. **"You've heard of them."**

**"Everyone's heard of them. You don't work in this world without knowing the Court exists. But I've never worked for them directly before. This was my first contract."**

**"And your last,"** Vivienne says quietly.

Marcus goes pale. **"I gave you everything. Everything I know. You said—"**

**"We said we needed information,"** I correct. **"We got it. Thank you."**

**"Please—"**

**"You photographed my wife,"** I tell him. **"In our bedroom. In private moments. You violated something sacred. You really think you're walking away from that?"**

**"I was just doing my job!"**

**"And now we're doing ours."**

Sera doesn't make it quick.

But she makes it quiet.

And when it's done, we have his laptop, his phone, his camera, and access to all his files.

Everything the Silent Court wanted to use against us.

Now ours.

**"Upload everything to our secure server,"** I tell one of our tech people. **"Then wipe his devices. Destroy the hardware. I want zero trace."**

**"And his body?"** they ask.

**"Gone. Completely. Like he never existed."**

They nod and get to work.

Vivienne and I step outside. The night air is cold. Clean. A relief after the basement.

**"One less variable,"** she observes.

**"One less threat."**

**"Tomorrow's still going to be chaos."**

**"Controlled chaos."**

**"Is there really such a thing?"**

**"We're about to find out."**

She leans against me. Just for a moment. Letting herself be tired. Letting herself be human.

**"Dante?"**

**"Mm?"**

**"If this goes wrong tomorrow—"**

**"It won't."**

**"But if it does. If one of us doesn't—"** She stops. Tries again. **"I just want you to know. These three days. This insane, bloodstained, violent three days. They've been the best of my life."**

I turn to face her. Cup her face in my hands.

**"Mine too,"** I tell her. **"And tomorrow won't be the end. It'll be the beginning. We're going to survive. Together. And then we're going to build something that makes the Silent Court look like amateurs."**

She smiles. Real. Genuine. Beautiful.

**"Promise?"**

**"Promise."**

We kiss. Long. Deep. Full of everything we can't say out loud.

When we pull apart, Sera is standing in the doorway, watching with that clinical fascination she has.

**"You two are disgustingly romantic,"** she observes. **"For psychopaths."**

**"Thank you,"** Vivienne and I say in unison.

Sera grins. **"Tomorrow should be fun."**

**"Fun,"** I echo. **"That's one word for it."**

**"What's another?"**

**"Apocalyptic."**

**"Even better."**

We head back inside.

Tomorrow is the dinner.

Tomorrow is the trap.

Tomorrow, we either win everything.

Or lose it all.

No middle ground.

No compromise.

Just blood.

And victory.

Or death.
