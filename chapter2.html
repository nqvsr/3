    <h1>CHAPTER 2</h1>
    <p class="chapter-title">Into Darkness</p>

    <p>Lyra moved through the forest like she was born to it, fluid, silent, deadly. I crashed after her like a bull through a shop, branches whipping my face, roots trying to trip me at every step.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Keep up!" she called back, not even winded.</p>

    <p>A shadow beast lunged from the darkness. I swung Stellaria on pure instinct. The blade cut through the creature like it was made of smoke, and it dissolved with a shriek.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Not completely useless," Lyra observed, silver magic forming a barrier behind us that the pursuing beasts slammed into like a wall. "Surprising."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Thanks for the vote of confidence," I panted.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Don't let it go to your head."</p>

    <p>Ahead, the forest changed. The trees grew darker, larger, twisted into shapes that seemed almost deliberate. The air itself felt different, thicker, watching.</p>

    <p>A wall of massive trees rose before us, their trunks carved with glowing symbols that hurt to look at directly. The entrance to the Shadowwood.</p>

    <p>We crashed through just as the shadow beasts reached us. The moment we crossed the threshold, they stopped, howling in frustration but refusing to follow.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"They fear what lives here," Lyra said, finally allowing herself to breathe hard. "That should tell you something."</p>

    <p>The Shadowwood was beautiful in the way poisonous things are beautiful, bioluminescent flowers bloomed in impossible colors, trees towered overhead with leaves that shimmered like captured starlight, and the very air seemed to hum with ancient power.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Stay close," Lyra said, and for the first time, there was no mockery in her voice. "The forest tests everyone who enters. It will show you things. Try to kill you with kindness and terror in equal measure."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You've been here before?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Priestess training. I barely survived." She glanced at me, and something shifted in her expression, still not warmth, but maybe not quite contempt. "Try not to die immediately. It would be inconvenient."</p>

    <p>Before I could respond, the ground erupted.</p>

    <p>Roots, massive, ancient, alive, burst from the earth and wrapped around my legs, my waist, pulling me down. Lyra cried out as more seized her, lifting her off the ground.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Stellaria!" I called out.</p>

    <p>The sword blazed, and I swung. The roots severed easily, but more came, dozens, hundreds, an endless assault.</p>

    <p>Lyra's magic flared, burning through the roots holding her, but she was tiring, I could see it in the way her movements slowed, the light dimming.</p>

    <p>A voice rolled through the forest like thunder made of leaves and wind.</p>

    <p class="dramatic">"WHY HAVE YOU DISTURBED MY DOMAIN?"</p>

    <p>The roots stopped. Drew back. From the shadows stepped a figure that belonged in myths and nightmares, easily ten feet tall, body woven from bark and living wood, antlers of twisted branches crowning his head, eyes like emeralds burning with ancient intelligence.</p>

    <p>Theron. The Nature Guardian.</p>

    <p>Lyra bowed immediately, deep and respectful. I followed her lead.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Great Guardian," she said, voice carefully neutral, "we seek your blessing. The Chosen Warrior requires your power to stop the Dark Lord."</p>

    <p>Those emerald eyes fixed on me, and I felt weighed, measured, found wanting.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Chosen?" Theron's laugh was the sound of trees cracking in a storm. "That <em>toy</em> chose this?" He gestured dismissively at me. "How many 'chosen' have I watched fail, priestess? How many corpses has this forest claimed from fools with prophecies?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I won't fail," I said, meeting his gaze because I refused to look away. Refused to be dismissed.</p>

    <p>Lyra hissed in warning, but Theron's expression shifted, not quite respect, but interest.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Bold words from a blacksmith." He raised one wooden hand, and the forest transformed around us. Three paths materialized, each radiating different energy.</p>

    <p><strong>Path of Strength</strong> - Battle sounds echoed from within, the clash of steel and roar of combat.</p>

    <p><strong>Path of Wisdom</strong> - Mirrors and impossible geometry, whispers of riddles that promised madness.</p>

    <p><strong>Path of Heart</strong> - Deceptively gentle, lined with flowers, emanating a wrongness that made my skin crawl.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Choose your trial, little warrior. Most take Strength, it's simple, brutal, fails quickly. The wise choose Wisdom. The truly brave..." He smiled, all teeth. "Well. The Heart is where heroes and fools are separated."</p>

    <p>Lyra grabbed my arm, pulling me aside. "Listen carefully," she whispered urgently. "Strength will kill you, you're not trained. Wisdom might work, but it takes time we don't have." She paused, conflict clear on her face. "Heart is... personal. It will dig into your deepest wounds and tear them open. But if you survive, the power you gain is extraordinary."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Which did you choose?" I asked.</p>

    <p>Her jaw tightened. "I didn't make it to the Guardians during training. I failed before I got here." For just a moment, vulnerability cracked through her armor. "Don't do the same."</p>

    <p>I looked at the three paths. At Theron waiting with ancient patience. At Stellaria pulsing in my grip.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"The Heart," I said firmly.</p>

    <p>Lyra's eyes widened. "You're insane."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You said it gives the most power."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"If you survive! Most don't, " She cut herself off, something unreadable crossing her face.</p>

    <p>Theron's smile grew. "Interesting. And you, priestess? Will you abandon him to face it alone?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I..." Lyra looked at me, and I saw the war in her eyes. Duty versus self-preservation. Contempt versus something newer, more uncertain.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Come with me," I said quietly. "Please."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Why?" The word was almost angry. "So I can watch you break? So your failure becomes mine too?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Because you're right, I might not make it. But if I don't, someone should know I tried." I held her gaze. "And because maybe we're stronger together than apart."</p>

    <p>For a long moment, she said nothing. Then, with a sound between a laugh and a sob:</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You're going to get me killed."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Is that a yes?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"It's a 'I'm too stubborn to let you die alone.'" She turned to Theron. "I'm going with him."</p>

    <p>The Guardian's expression softened, just slightly. "Then you may both enter. But know this, the Path of Heart shows what the heart hides. Every fear, every wound, every secret you've buried. And it shows you each other's."</p>

    <p>Lyra went pale.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Still want to come?" I asked.</p>

    <p>She squared her shoulders, lifted her chin. "I made my choice. Let's get this over with."</p>

    <p>We stepped onto the Path of Heart together.</p>

    <p>The world dissolved into light.</p>
