    <h1>CHAPTER 8</h1>
    <p class="chapter-title">Dawn</p>

    <div class="scene-break">✧ ✧ ✧</div>

    <p>Three months later, I stood in the great hall of the capital, barely recognizing the man I'd become.</p>

    <p>The kingdom had survived, battered but unbroken. Malachar's army, leaderless and purposeless, had scattered to the winds. Some had been destroyed by vengeful survivors. Others had fled to wild lands beyond civilization's reach. The capital was damaged, buildings still bore scorch marks, streets were still being rebuilt, but it was standing. Alive. Full of people who'd been given a future they'd thought was lost.</p>

    <p>And now, the king himself was honoring us.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"For extraordinary courage in the face of annihilation," King Aldric announced to the assembled court, "for sacrificing everything to save a kingdom that asked everything of you, I name you both Guardians of Alveron. Protectors of the realm. Heroes who will be remembered in song and story for a thousand years."</p>

    <p>The crowd erupted in thunderous cheers that shook the rafters.</p>

    <p>Beside me, Lyra wore pristine white and silver robes that caught the light like captured moonbeams, her hair adorned with flowers. She caught my eye and smiled, that warm, genuine, utterly unguarded smile I'd fallen desperately in love with, and I felt my heart swell almost painfully in my chest.</p>

    <p>After the ceremony, after the endless stream of nobles wanting to shake our hands and thank us, we finally escaped to the palace gardens, desperate for quiet and privacy.</p>

    <p>We walked hand in hand through paths lined with night-blooming jasmine.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Guardian of Alveron," she mused, voice light with happiness. "I could definitely get used to that."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Better than 'disappointment'?" I teased mercilessly.</p>

    <p>She laughed, swatting my arm. "I apologized for that! Multiple times! With great sincerity!"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I know. But I'm never, ever letting you forget it."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Insufferable blacksmith," she said with mock severity.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Arrogant priestess," I countered.</p>

    <p>She stopped walking abruptly, turning to face me. "About that. I've been thinking about something important."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Dangerous," I said automatically.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Hush." She took both my hands. "The temple... they sent envoys. Asked me to come back. Resume my duties as High Priestess. Said all was forgiven, that I'd be welcomed home with honor."</p>

    <p>My heart sank like a stone. "Oh."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I told them no," she said simply.</p>

    <p>Hope flared so suddenly it took my breath away. "You did?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I'm done living by their rules. Done hiding what I feel behind walls of ice and perfection." Her violet eyes blazed with fierce conviction. "Done being what they tried to carve me into. You taught me that caring isn't weakness. That love is worth any risk. That feeling everything, even when it terrifies you, is what makes us human. What makes us <em>alive</em>."</p>

    <p>She pulled out a small velvet box. Inside was a ring, elegant silver, deceptively simple, set with a stone that seemed to hold captured moonlight.</p>

    <p>My breath caught in my throat. My heart forgot how to beat.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I know traditionally the man asks," she said, and her voice was shaking slightly. "But I've never been traditional. I've never followed the rules. And I absolutely refuse to let you beat me to this."</p>

    <p>She dropped gracefully to one knee. Several nobles who'd followed us into the garden gasped audibly at the sight of the famous High Priestess kneeling before a blacksmith.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You're incredible," Lyra said, tears already streaming down her face. "You saw me at my absolute worst, cold and cruel and so terrified of feeling anything that I tried to destroy what was growing between us, and you loved me anyway. You made me brave when I'd forgotten how to be brave. Made me believe I could be more than what I was told to be. You gave me back myself."</p>

    <p>She swallowed hard.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Will you marry me? Will you let me spend the rest of my life loving you the way you deserve to be loved? Will you be my partner, my equal, my home?"</p>

    <p>I pulled her to her feet and kissed her with everything I had as the garden erupted in applause and cheers.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Yes," I said against her lips. "Yes, absolutely yes, a thousand times yes."</p>

    <p>She slipped the ring onto my finger with shaking hands, and I felt the magic in it settle against my skin like a promise.</p>

    <p>Then I pulled out a small box of my own that I'd been carrying for weeks. Inside was a ring I'd forged myself, simple, practical, but set with a stone that held what looked like captured starlight, a fragment of the meteor that had started everything.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Great minds," I said, grinning through my own tears.</p>

    <p>She laughed, that wonderful, unguarded, joyful sound, as I slipped the ring onto her finger.</p>

    <p>We kissed again as the sun set over the kingdom we'd saved together, painting the sky in impossible shades of gold and crimson and violet.</p>

    <p>Stellaria, resting peacefully at my hip, pulsed with warm approval.</p>

    <p>In the distance, I could sense new adventures waiting. The Fire Guardian was still out there somewhere, and rumors were already circulating about darkness stirring in distant lands. There would always be another battle, another threat, another call to adventure.</p>

    <p>But for now, for this perfect, crystalline moment, I had everything I needed: the woman I loved more than life itself, a kingdom at peace, and the promise of all our tomorrows stretching out before us.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Ready for the next adventure?" Lyra asked, violet eyes sparkling.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"With you?" I pulled her closer. "Always. Forever. Until the stars fall again and the world ends and even after that."</p>

    <p>And so our story continued, not as chosen warrior and reluctant priestess, not as prophecy and duty, but as partners and lovers and best friends who'd found each other in the darkness and chosen each other in the light.</p>

    <p>Together.</p>

    <p>Forever.</p>

    <p>Always.</p>
