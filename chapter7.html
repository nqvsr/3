    <h1>CHAPTER 7</h1>
    <p class="chapter-title">Into Shadow</p>

    <div class="scene-break">✧ ✧ ✧</div>

    <p>Morning came too soon.</p>

    <p>We dressed in silence, the weight of what lay ahead settling over us like armor.</p>

    <p>Glacius waited at the portal. "The path is open. May you find the strength you need."</p>

    <p>We stepped through.</p>

    <p>The Shadowlands were a nightmare given geography, eternal twilight, twisted trees growing from black soil, a sky churning with dark clouds that never broke. In the distance, Malachar's fortress rose like an obsidian dagger stabbing into the heavens, crackling with malevolent energy.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"There," Lyra said, voice tight. "I can sense him."</p>

    <p>We moved through the corrupted landscape. Shadow beasts prowled, but disorganized, no patrols, no coordination. They really hadn't expected an attack here.</p>

    <p>We cut through them with ruthless efficiency. My nature and ice magic flowing through Stellaria, Lyra's silver light burning away corruption. Together, we were unstoppable.</p>

    <p>The fortress gates loomed, massive, sealed with dark runes.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Stand back," I said.</p>

    <p>I channeled both powers. Roots erupted from poisoned ground, wrapping around the gates. Ice spread across metal, making it brittle. Together, the forces shattered the entrance.</p>

    <p>Inside was a labyrinth of nightmare architecture, impossible angles, corridors that seemed to shift, chambers that defied physics.</p>

    <p>We fought through shadow guards, corrupted creatures, twisted things that should never have existed. Every battle brought us deeper.</p>

    <p>Finally, we reached the throne room.</p>

    <div class="scene-break">✧ ✧ ✧</div>

    <p>It was vast, a cathedral of darkness. And at its center, seated on a throne of bones and solidified shadow, was Malachar.</p>

    <p>He was barely humanoid. More a void given shape, darkness so absolute it hurt to look at directly. Red eyes burned in the emptiness where his face should have been, not flames but dying stars.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"So," his voice was grinding stone and breaking glass, the sound of worlds ending. "The Chosen Warrior comes to me. How... <em>convenient</em>."</p>

    <p>He stood, and the room filled with suffocating darkness.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You cannot defeat me, child. I am eternal. I am death incarnate. I have ended civilizations. What are you? A blacksmith with a shiny sword?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Maybe," I said, raising Stellaria. The blade blazed with green life and blue ice. "But I'm not alone."</p>

    <p>Lyra's hands glowed with silver fire. "And we're not afraid of you."</p>

    <p>Malachar laughed, and the sound was the death of hope.</p>

    <p>Then he attacked.</p>

    <p>Dark energy exploded toward us. We dove aside, rolling behind pillars of black stone.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Pure shadow," Lyra said quickly. "Physical attacks won't work well. But look, " She pointed at the throne room's architecture. Ancient runes carved into walls, chains hanging from ceiling. "This fortress wasn't built by him. It's old. Pre-Malachar."</p>

    <p>I understood immediately. "A prison. Designed to hold creatures like him."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Exactly. The runes, they're binding spells. If we can activate them..."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"We need his power to fuel them." My tactical mind was racing. "Make him attack. Waste energy. Redirect it into the runes."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"That means one of us has to draw his fire while the other works the spell."</p>

    <p>Our eyes met. We both knew what that meant.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I'll do it," we said in unison.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Together," Lyra said suddenly. "We draw his fire together. Force him to split his attention. I work the runes while you keep him off balance with attacks."</p>

    <p>It was insane.</p>

    <p>It might work.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"On three," I said.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Three," she confirmed.</p>

    <p>We charged.</p>

    <p>I went right, she went left. Malachar roared, shadow spears manifesting and shooting toward both of us.</p>

    <p>I dodged, weaving through the throne room, using Stellaria to block what I couldn't avoid. Each parry sent shocks up my arm, this darkness was heavy, wrong, it wanted to consume everything.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"IS THIS YOUR BEST?" I shouted. "No wonder you hide behind armies!"</p>

    <p>His red eyes blazed brighter. Good. Angry meant sloppy.</p>

    <p>Behind him, Lyra was working, hands tracing the ancient runes, silver magic making them glow.</p>

    <p>Malachar noticed, whirled to strike her.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"HEY!" I channeled ice through Stellaria and sent a wave of frost at him.</p>

    <p>It did nothing to hurt him, but it got his attention. He turned back to me, and this time the darkness he unleashed was tsunami-scale.</p>

    <p>I drove Stellaria into the ground, roots erupting to form a shield. The darkness consumed them, but more grew, again and again, nature's endless persistence against void's hunger.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You're WEAK!" I roared. "Just shadow and fear! Nothing real!"</p>

    <p class="dramatic">"I AM DEATH ITSELF!"</p>

    <p>His form expanded, growing massive, filling the chamber.</p>

    <p>Perfect. Loss of control.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"NOW!" Lyra screamed.</p>

    <p>Silver light shot from her palms to the runes. They blazed to life, ancient magic activating, chains of pure radiance erupting from walls and ceiling.</p>

    <p>Malachar realized too late.</p>

    <p>The chains wrapped around him, burning through shadow. He shrieked, a sound that shattered stone and cracked the air itself.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"The runes are holding!" Lyra shouted. "But I need more power to complete the binding!"</p>

    <p>I ran to her, channeling everything, ice, nature, my own life force, into Stellaria. The sword became a beacon.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Together!" I grabbed her hand.</p>

    <p>Our powers merged, her silver light, my dual elements, the fortress's ancient magic. The combination was blinding, beautiful, transcendent.</p>

    <p>The binding runes flared like newborn suns. More chains erupted.</p>

    <p>Malachar fought, but he'd wasted too much power, and now it was being used against him.</p>

    <p class="dramatic">"NO! I CANNOT BE CONTAINED!"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Nothing is eternal," I said. "Everything ends. Even you."</p>

    <p>With Lyra's hand in mine, we poured everything into the binding.</p>

    <p>Malachar's form compressed, shrinking, darkness collapsing inward.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You may bind me," he hissed, "but darkness always returns, "</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Let it," Lyra said. "We'll be ready."</p>

    <p>Final pulse of light. The binding completed. Malachar was pulled into the floor, sealed beneath layers of ancient magic.</p>

    <p>The throne room shook. Settled. Silence.</p>

    <p>We stood there, hands clasped, breathing hard. Stellaria's glow faded to gentle shimmer.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Did we..." I started.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"We did." Lyra laughed. "We actually did it."</p>

    <p>Then the fortress groaned, and cracks spider-webbed across the ceiling.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Without Malachar's power," Lyra said, "the entire structure is collapsing!"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Time to go!"</p>

    <p>We sprinted through corridors actively crumbling. Outside, shadow beasts were dissolving. The Moonstriders waited.</p>

    <p>We leaped onto their backs and rode hard as the fortress collapsed behind us in a massive cloud of dust and fading darkness.</p>
