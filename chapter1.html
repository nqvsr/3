    <h1>CHAPTER 1</h1>
    <p class="chapter-title">When Stars Fall</p>

    <div class="scene-break">✧ ✧ ✧</div>

    <p>The night sky didn't just tear, it <em>hemorrhaged</em>.</p>

    <p>I'd seen falling stars before. Every child in Oakwood Village had wished upon them, chased them through summer fields sticky with heat and possibility, believed they carried dreams from the heavens like letters written in light. But this, this was no dream. This was a spear of molten gold and ancient fury, screaming through the darkness like a god's dying scream, and it was hurtling toward me with the inevitability of fate itself.</p>

    <p>Any sane man would have run. Any sensible soul would have thrown themselves into the forest, away from the impact that promised to split the world in two.</p>

    <p>I stood frozen.</p>

    <p>My calloused hands still gripped the hammer from my evening shift at the forge, its familiar weight suddenly meaningless against the cosmic violence descending from above. My father's voice echoed in my mind like a prayer I'd long since stopped believing: <span class="emphasis">"Stay out of trouble, boy. Keep your head down. You're a blacksmith, not a hero. Heroes die young and pointless, and their families starve in the aftermath."</span></p>

    <p>The meteor struck with a sound that wasn't a sound, it was the death of silence itself, the birth of chaos, the universe screaming. The impact wave threw me to my knees, and the forest around me shook like a wounded animal crying out in pain. Pine trees centuries old groaned and bent, their roots tearing from earth that had held them since before my grandfather's grandfather drew breath.</p>

    <p>The ground beneath me <em>screamed</em>.</p>

    <p>Then, silence.</p>

    <p>The kind that comes after someone stops breathing. When even the insects hold their breath, waiting to see if the world will remember how to exist.</p>

    <p>Light bled through the trees next. Not the warm orange of forge-fire or the gentle gold of lanterns. This was <em>ancient</em> light, the kind that existed before men named it, before we tried to capture it in words like "beautiful" or "holy" or "terrifying."</p>

    <p>Pure. Terrible. Beckoning.</p>

    <p>I walked toward it. Of course I did.</p>

    <p>Because deep down, beneath all my father's warnings and the weight of ordinary expectations, some part of me had been waiting for this moment. Some secret, shameful part of my soul had been screaming into the void every night: <span class="internal-thought">Please. Gods, please. Let me be more than this. Let me matter.</span></p>

    <p>The gods, it seemed, were listening.</p>

    <p>They always are. That's the terrible part.</p>

    <h3>The Sword in the Stars</h3>

    <p>The crater was impossibly small for the violence that had created it. No spreading destruction, no forest aflame, just scorched earth in a perfect circle, and at its center, a sword.</p>

    <p>Not <em>embedded</em> in the earth. Not <em>thrust</em> into stone like some legend from children's tales. It stood there as if it had always been there, as if the world had formed around it and was only now remembering it existed.</p>

    <p>The blade caught starlight and made it <em>solid</em>, silver-white metal that seemed to pulse with its own heartbeat. Runes I'd never seen carved themselves into the surface as I watched, glowing with rhythmic light. A language older than kingdoms. Older than men.</p>

    <p>My hand reached out before my mind could stop it.</p>

    <p>The moment my calloused fingers touched the leather-wrapped hilt, the world didn't just change, it <em>exploded</em> into my consciousness with the force of revelation.</p>

    <p class="dramatic">Visions.</p>

    <p>Not gentle visions. Not soft prophecies whispered by kindly seers. These were visions that <em>violated</em> reality, kingdoms burning under crimson skies, cities swallowed by shadow that moved and breathed and <em>hungered</em>, an army of nightmares marching beneath banners of pure darkness.</p>

    <p>I saw mothers clutching dead children. Saw heroes die screaming. Saw the world itself being devoured by something vast and hungry and ancient.</p>

    <p>And through it all, a voice. Feminine. Ancient. <em>Eternal</em>.</p>

    <p class="emphasis">"Finally. The last Chosen. I am Stellaria, forged in the dying breath of the first star, tempered in the tears of forgotten gods. The darkness rises for the final time, young blacksmith. You are humanity's last chance. You are their final hope. You are, "</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I'm nobody!" The words ripped from my throat, desperate and raw. "I'm just a blacksmith's son! I shoe horses and mend plows! I'm not, I can't be, "</p>

    <p class="emphasis">"You are what the stars have chosen. What you were matters less than what you must become. And you will become, Kael Thornforge. Or you will watch everything you love turn to ash."</p>

    <p>I tried to release the sword. Every muscle in my body screamed to let go, to run, to return to my simple life. But my hand wouldn't open. Or the sword wouldn't let go.</p>

    <p>I couldn't tell which, and the distinction suddenly seemed meaningless.</p>

    <p>A twig snapped behind me.</p>

    <p>I spun, and Stellaria moved with supernatural grace, its point aimed at the intruder's throat before conscious thought could catch up with instinct.</p>

    <p>The woman standing ten feet away didn't flinch.</p>

    <h3>The Ice Queen</h3>

    <p>She stood there like she'd been carved from moonlight and given breath, hair the color of starlight silver cascading past her shoulders in waves that caught the glow from Stellaria. Her eyes were violet. Not purple, not lavender, <em>violet</em>, like twilight given form, like the moment between day and night when the world holds its breath.</p>

    <p>Those eyes looked at me, and I felt <em>weighed</em>. Measured. Found catastrophically wanting.</p>

    <p>The white robes marked her instantly: Moon Temple. A Priestess of the Sacred Order. The kind of woman who'd spent her entire life in marble halls, who'd never touched dirt or known hunger or felt the burn of honest labor.</p>

    <p>Beautiful. Impossibly, dangerously, infuriatingly beautiful.</p>

    <p>And looking at me like I was a mistake the universe had made.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You?" Her voice could have frozen fire. "The sword chose... <em>you</em>?"</p>

    <p>The contempt in that single word carved into me deeper than any blade. I became suddenly, painfully aware of everything I was: the soot on my face, the coal-dust in my hair, the leather apron still tied at my waist. The smell of honest sweat and iron that clung to me like a second skin.</p>

    <p>Everything that marked me as <em>less than</em>.</p>

    <p>I lowered Stellaria slowly, fighting the urge to hide it behind my back. "And you are?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Disappointed." She circled me like a predator assessing prey. "I am Lyra Moonwhisper, High Priestess of the Moon Temple, Keeper of the Sacred Flame, Guardian of the Eternal Light."</p>

    <p>She paused in front of me, close enough that I could smell her, moonflowers and frost, expensive perfume and impossible elegance.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"When the prophecy spoke of the Starfall Warrior, I envisioned someone... <em>worthy</em>. A knight with honor earned in battle. A scholar with wisdom beyond years. A prince, perhaps, with noble blood and divine right." Her gaze raked over me with withering precision. "Not a soot-stained peasant who reeks of cheap ale and cheaper ambition."</p>

    <p>Heat flushed my cheeks, shame, anger, both burning in my chest. "I didn't ask for this."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Clearly." She stopped in front of me again, deliberately close. "But the sword has chosen, however poor its judgment. Which means we're stuck with each other."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"We?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Did you think you could face the Dark Lord Malachar alone?" The contempt in her voice could have stripped paint. "Three days from now, his army reaches the capital. Fifty thousand shadow beasts. Thousands will die in the first hour. The kingdom will fall by nightfall. And you, " she jabbed a finger into my chest, ", are supposed to stop it."</p>

    <p>The weight of Stellaria suddenly felt unbearable.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"How?"</p>

    <p>Something flickered across her face, too quick to read, gone before I could name it. She pulled a glowing crystal from her robes. Moonstone, pulsing with inner light.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"The Guardians," she said, voice dropping to something almost like reverence. "Three ancient beings who hold the keys to Stellaria's full power. Without them, you're just a blacksmith waving a fancy sword. With them..."</p>

    <p>She paused, and for just a moment, I saw something real beneath the ice. Fear. Hope. Desperation.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"With them, you might, <em>might</em>, have a prayer."</p>

    <p>The crystal floated between us, projecting images: a temple of ice in mountains that touched the sky, storms raging around towers of frozen crystal. A fortress of mirrors lost in endless desert. A grove of ancient trees wrapped in eternal shadow.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"North, East, or West," Lyra said flatly. "Ice, Fire, or Nature. Choose one. We leave within the hour."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Wait, " Nothing about this made sense. "Why you? Why are <em>you</em> here?"</p>

    <p>Her expression shuttered closed so fast I heard the walls slam into place.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Because the temple sent me. Because duty demands it. Because someone has to make sure you don't get yourself killed before you're useful."</p>

    <p>Lies. Every word dripped with them.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Not good enough," I pressed.</p>

    <p>Her magic flared, silver light crackling around her clenched fists. For a heartbeat, I thought she might strike me.</p>

    <p>Then she exhaled. Slowly. Deliberately. Forcing calm.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Because I watched my village burn when I was eight years old."</p>

    <p>Each word was precisely cut. Controlled.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Because I stood behind temple walls while shadow beasts tore through the countryside, killing everyone I'd ever known. My mother. My father. My little brother who was only five and loved birds more than anything." Her voice cracked. "Because the priestesses told me it was the will of the gods, that some must die so others may live, and I have <em>hated</em> that answer every single day since."</p>

    <p>Her eyes locked onto mine, and the fury there was breathtaking.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"So when prophecy spoke of a warrior who could end this, who could stop the darkness once and for all, I volunteered. Not because I believe in you. But because I refuse to watch another village burn while I do nothing."</p>

    <p>Silence stretched between us, heavy with things unsaid.</p>

    <p>A howl shattered the moment. Distant but getting closer. Then another. And another.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Shadow beasts." Lyra's hands ignited with silver fire. "They've found us. We need to move. <em>Now</em>."</p>

    <p>She turned toward the forest.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"The Shadowwood lies west. It's closest and most dangerous, which means you'll probably choose it and die within the first trial."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Why would I choose the most dangerous?"</p>

    <p>She glanced back, contempt back in full force, but underneath, I caught something else. Something that looked like <em>hope</em>.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Because men like you always choose wrong, blacksmith. It's practically destiny. Now move before we both die here."</p>

    <p>Before I could respond, she vanished into the trees, silver light trailing behind her.</p>

    <p>I looked down at Stellaria, still glowing in my hand.</p>

    <p class="emphasis">"She's not wrong about the danger. But she's wrong about you. The question is, which will you prove first?"</p>

    <p>The howls were closer now. I could see red eyes glinting in the darkness. Moving. Hunting. <em>Hungry</em>.</p>

    <p>Three paths. Three guardians. Three ways to die, or become something more.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"If she thinks I'll fail," I muttered, "then I'll just have to prove her wrong."</p>

    <p>I ran after Lyra, Stellaria blazing in my grip, shadow beasts erupting from the darkness in pursuit.</p>

    <p>The choice was made.</p>

    <p>The gods were watching.</p>

    <p>And somewhere in the distance, the Dark Lord Malachar began to laugh.</p>
