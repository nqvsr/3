    <h1>CHAPTER 4</h1>
    <p class="chapter-title">The Journey North</p>

    <div class="scene-break">✧ ✧ ✧</div>

    <p>The Moonstriders ran like poetry given physical form, effortless, swift, consuming distance that should have taken days in mere hours.</p>

    <p>Lyra rode beside me, and the silence between us had changed. No longer hostile. Just... uncertain.</p>

    <p>As the forest gave way to foothills and snow began to fall, she spoke.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"In the trial. You saw everything. My childhood, the temple, all of it."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Yes."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I don't know how to feel about that." She kept her eyes forward. "I spent years building walls. Making sure no one could see weakness. And you just... saw all of it."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"If it helps," I said carefully, "I didn't see weakness. I saw someone who survived something cruel and came out still wanting to help people. That's strength."</p>

    <p>She glanced at me, something vulnerable flickering across her face. "You keep saying things like that."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Like what?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Like you mean them." She paused. "Like you see something in me I don't see in myself."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Maybe I do."</p>

    <p>We rode in silence for another mile. Then:</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I misjudged you," she said quietly. "You're not what I expected."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Better or worse?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Different." A pause. "Better."</p>

    <p>It was the first genuine compliment she'd given me. It felt more valuable than gold.</p>

    <div class="scene-break">✧ ✧ ✧</div>

    <p>By nightfall, we reached an abandoned mountain shelter, stone walls, a small fireplace, clearly meant for travelers in gentler times.</p>

    <p>Lyra created magical flames, silver and warm. We sat close to the fire, Moonstriders resting outside, somehow immune to the cold.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Can I ask you something?" Lyra said, staring into the flames.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Of course."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Why did you defend me? In the trial, when you saw my memories. You could have focused on your own. Saving yourself would have been easier."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You were in pain."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"So were you."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Yes," I admitted. "But mine was old pain. Fears I'd lived with. Yours... you were watching your worst memories on repeat, and no one should have to face that alone."</p>

    <p>She turned to look at me fully. In the firelight, her silver hair seemed to glow, her violet eyes reflecting dancing flames.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"No one's ever..." She stopped, started again. "The temple taught me that compassion was a liability. That caring would only bring pain. For years, I believed them."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"And now?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Now I'm confused." A small, genuine smile. "You're confusing. This whole thing is confusing."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Welcome to my world," I said, and she laughed, actual laughter, light and real.</p>

    <p>The sound was beautiful.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Thank you," she said after the laughter faded. "For earlier. For what you said. I don't think anyone's ever called me brave before."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Then they weren't paying attention."</p>

    <p>Our eyes met and held. Something passed between us, recognition, connection, the first threads of something neither of us had names for yet.</p>

    <p>Then a howl shattered the moment.</p>

    <p>Not shadow beasts. Something different. Colder.</p>

    <p>Lyra was on her feet instantly, magic flaring. "Ice wraiths. Malachar's creatures, they've tracked us."</p>

    <p>Through the shelter's window, I saw them. Ghostly figures made of living frost, eyes glowing pale blue, dozens of them converging on our position.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Too many to fight directly," Lyra said, already calculating. "We can run on the Moonstriders, but in snow this deep they might catch us. Or we make a stand here, there are protection runes, but they're ancient, weak."</p>

    <p>I felt Stellaria pulse with the new nature power Theron had given me. An idea formed.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"The environment," I said. "There are roots beneath the snow, frozen plants. If I can wake them with nature magic..."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You've never used that power before," Lyra warned. "It could drain you completely. Kill you."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Or save us."</p>

    <p>She looked at me for a long moment. Then: "Do it. I'll support you with my magic. Together."</p>

    <p>That word again. Together.</p>

    <p>I stepped outside into the snow, Stellaria blazing in my grip. "I need you to trust me."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I do," Lyra said, and the shock of hearing those words from her gave me strength.</p>

    <p>The ice wraiths shrieked, rushing toward us like an avalanche of hate.</p>

    <p>I drove Stellaria into the snow-covered ground and reached out with the new power, feeling for life beneath the frozen earth.</p>

    <p>At first, nothing. Just cold. Death. Ice.</p>

    <p>Then, deep below, I felt them. Dormant roots. Seeds waiting for spring. Life sleeping but not gone.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Wake up," I whispered, pouring energy into the earth. "Please. I need you."</p>

    <p>Stellaria erupted with green-gold light. The ground trembled.</p>

    <p>The wraiths were feet away when the earth answered.</p>

    <p>Massive roots exploded from beneath the snow, alive and angry. Vines thick as a man's body erupted, wrapping around the ice creatures. They screamed, a sound like glaciers cracking, as the living wood squeezed.</p>

    <p>But there were so many. I felt my energy draining like water from a broken dam, vision blurring, legs shaking.</p>

    <p>Then Lyra's hand pressed against my back, and silver light poured into me.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I've got you," she said fiercely. "We do this together."</p>

    <p>Her magic merged with mine, amplifying everything. More roots answered. The earth itself rose up, creating a living barrier between us and the wraiths.</p>

    <p>Together, our combined power was overwhelming. One by one, the ice creatures shattered against nature's fury.</p>

    <p>When the last wraith dissolved, the roots gently retreated. I collapsed.</p>

    <p>Lyra caught me before I hit the ground, lowering me gently. "That was incredible," she breathed. "I've never seen nature magic like that."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Couldn't have..." I panted, "...done it without you."</p>

    <p>She helped me inside, wrapped a blanket around both of us as we sat by the fire. I was completely drained, shivering despite the warmth.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Here." She pulled me close, her arms around me. "Body heat. Fastest way to recover from magical exhaustion."</p>

    <p>I was too tired to question it. Not that I wanted to.</p>

    <div class="scene-break">✧ ✧ ✧</div>

    <p>We sat like that in comfortable silence. Gradually, my strength returned. But neither of us moved apart.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Thank you," I said finally. "For trusting me."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Thank you for being worth trusting." Her voice was soft, almost shy, so different from the ice queen who'd mocked me days ago. "I'm not... good at this. At being open. The temple spent years training it out of me."</p>

    <p>I pulled back to look at her properly. In the firelight, she was breathtaking, silver hair disheveled from battle, violet eyes reflecting flames, cheeks still flushed from the magic we'd shared.</p>

    <p>Something shifted in me. A decision crystalized.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow we might die. And this woman, this brilliant, brave, beautiful woman who'd been carved into ice by years of cruelty, deserved to feel something real before the end.</p>

    <p>I cupped her face in both hands and kissed her.</p>

    <p>Not asking. Not hesitating. Just taking the moment we both knew was inevitable.</p>

    <p>She froze in shock for half a heartbeat, then melted with a soft gasp that sent heat through my veins. Her hands clutched at my shirt, pulling me closer as the kiss deepened.</p>

    <p>When I finally pulled back, she stared at me with wide, dazed eyes, lips parted, breathing hard.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You..." she started, voice shaking. "You just..."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I did." I traced her lower lip with my thumb, watching her shiver. "Problem?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I, no, that was..." She couldn't seem to form coherent words, cheeks flaming red. "You can't just... I mean..."</p>

    <p>I'd never seen the composed High Priestess so utterly flustered. It was intoxicating.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Can't what?" I asked, voice low, deliberately teasing.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Kiss me like that without warning!" But there was no anger in her protest, only breathless confusion.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Would you rather I asked permission first? Wrote a formal request to the temple?" I leaned closer, watching her pupils dilate. "Or should I just do it again?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I..." She bit her lip, and I watched the internal war play out across her face, temple training versus desire. Desire won. "Again. Please."</p>

    <p>This time when I kissed her, she was ready. She matched my intensity, all her carefully constructed walls crumbling. Her hands tangled in my hair, desperate sounds escaping her throat that drove me wild.</p>

    <p>When we parted, both breathless, she looked at me with wonder and fear.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"What are you doing to me?" she whispered.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Showing you what you've been missing." I traced kisses along her jaw, down her neck, feeling her pulse race. "All those years the temple told you feeling was weakness?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Yes," she gasped as I found a sensitive spot.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"They lied." I pulled back to meet her eyes. "You're not weak for feeling, Lyra. You're brave enough to let yourself feel when everyone told you not to."</p>

    <p>Tears welled in her eyes. "I don't know how to do this. To just... want something for myself."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Then let me show you." I kissed her again, slower, teaching without words. "Let yourself feel. No rules. No temple. Just us."</p>

    <p>She followed my lead, hands exploring tentatively, then with growing confidence. When I deepened the kiss, she moaned softly, pressing closer.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Is this..." she panted when we paused for air, "are we..."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Tell me to stop," I murmured against her skin, "and I will."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Don't." Her voice was fierce despite the trembling. "Don't stop. I want... I need..." She couldn't finish, overwhelmed.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Tell me what you need."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You," she whispered. "I want... all of you. I'm done hiding, done being what they told me to be. Tonight I want to be just... me. With you."</p>

    <p>The words hung in the air between us, heavy with promise and possibility.</p>

    <p>Outside, the snow continued to fall, blanketing the world in quiet white. Inside, the fire crackled and danced, painting us both in gold and shadow.</p>

    <p>And in that moment, nothing else mattered.</p>
