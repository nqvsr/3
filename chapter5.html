    <h1>CHAPTER 5</h1>
    <p class="chapter-title">The Ice Temple</p>

    <p>Morning came with brilliant sunshine on endless white. We woke still holding each other, and there was a moment of sweet awkwardness before Lyra smiled, genuinely smiled, and kissed me good morning.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"We should talk about this," she said.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Later," I suggested. "After we don't die?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Practical."</p>

    <p>The Moonstriders carried us higher into the mountains. The air grew thin, cold enough to burn lungs. But we rode close together, hands occasionally brushing, small touches that meant everything.</p>

    <p>By midday, we saw it.</p>

    <p>The Ice Temple rose from the mountain peak like a cathedral carved from winter itself, massive spires of crystal and ice, walls that seemed to glow from within, architecture that defied physics and reason.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"The Temple of Eternal Frost," Lyra breathed. "I never thought I'd actually see it."</p>

    <p>As we approached, a wall of ice erupted from the ground, blocking our path.</p>

    <p>A voice boomed across the mountain: <strong>"WHO DARES DISTURB THE ETERNAL FROST?"</strong></p>

    <p>The ice before us shifted, formed, became a figure, massive, easily fifteen feet tall, made entirely of crystal and compressed snow. Eyes like frozen stars burned in a face both beautiful and terrible.</p>

    <p>Glacius. The Ice Guardian.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I am the Chosen Warrior," I called, holding up Stellaria. "I bear the blessing of Theron. I seek your power to stop the Dark Lord Malachar."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Many seek power." Glacius's voice was like avalanches given speech. "Few deserve it. Theron may have found you worthy, but I am less easily impressed."</p>

    <p>He leaned forward, and the temperature plummeted further.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You will face my trial, or you will freeze where you stand."</p>

    <p>Before I could respond, the world turned white.</p>

    <p>When the whiteness cleared, I stood alone in a vast chamber of ice. Glacius towered before me, refracting light into a thousand colors.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Three questions," he said. "Three truths. Lie even once, and the ice claims you forever."</p>

    <p>Three mirrors of ice formed around me, each showing my reflection from different angles.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"First question:" His eyes blazed. <strong>"Why do you fight? Is it truly to save the kingdom, or do you simply want to prove you're more than a blacksmith?"</strong></p>

    <p>The question struck deep. I could lie. Make myself look noble.</p>

    <p>The ice crackled, waiting.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Both," I said, forcing honesty. "I want to save people. I want to stop the darkness. But yes, part of me wants to prove I'm worthy of this sword. That I'm not just lucky. That I matter."</p>

    <p>The first mirror shattered into light.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Honest." Glacius nodded. "Even when it reveals imperfection. Second question:" His voice dropped, colder than before. <strong>"You have grown close to the priestess. If forced to choose, her life or the kingdom's salvation, which would you choose?"</strong></p>

    <p>My heart clenched. Images flashed, Lyra's smile, her hand in mine, her lips against mine. Then thousands of faces I'd never met, villages I'd never seen.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I..." The truth tasted like ash. "I don't know if I'm strong enough to choose the kingdom. I want to say I would. But standing here, being honest?" I closed my eyes. "I think I'd choose her. I'd try to find another way, but if there was no other way... I'd save Lyra. And spend the rest of my life trying to make it right."</p>

    <p>Silence stretched. Then the second mirror exploded into brilliance.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"The hardest truths shame us most," Glacius said, almost gently. "But acknowledging weakness is how we master it. Third question, final question:"</p>

    <p>The temperature plummeted. Frost formed on my skin.</p>

    <p class="dramatic">"Do you believe you will succeed? Do you truly think a blacksmith can defeat Malachar, who has conquered death itself?"</p>

    <p>This was it. The deepest truth.</p>

    <p>I looked at my reflection. Young. Inexperienced. Armed with a weapon I barely understood.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"No," I whispered. "I don't think I can defeat him. Not alone."</p>

    <p>The ice cracked around me. Had I failed?</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"But," I continued, voice strengthening, "I'm not alone. Stellaria chose me. Theron blessed me. Lyra stands with me. And I believe, truly believe, that together we have a chance. Not because I'm special. Because we refuse to give up."</p>

    <p>I met Glacius's frozen gaze.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"So no, I don't know if I'll win. But I'll fight until I can't anymore."</p>

    <p>The third mirror didn't shatter.</p>

    <p>It melted. Turned to water, then light.</p>

    <p>The chamber filled with radiance.</p>

    <p>Glacius bowed his massive head. "You pass, Chosen Warrior. You spoke truth even when it revealed doubt and fear. That is the rarest courage."</p>

    <p>He placed one crystalline hand on Stellaria. Ice and frost spiraled around the blade, merging with the green nature energy. The sword transformed, shimmering with both life and winter, green and blue perfectly balanced.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"The power of eternal ice. You can freeze enemies, create shields of frost, endure any cold." He paused. "But more, I give you clarity. The ice's truth. May it guide you in the darkness ahead."</p>

    <p>The frozen world dissolved. I was outside the temple, and Lyra was running toward me.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Hours!" she said, throwing her arms around me. "You were gone for hours!"</p>

    <p>I held her tight, feeling Stellaria pulse with dual power.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Are you alright?" she asked, pulling back to search my face.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I am now."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You passed?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I told the truth. All of it."</p>

    <p>She smiled. "Of course you did."</p>

    <p>I hesitated, then decided truth had worked so far. "One of the questions was about you. About choosing between you and the kingdom."</p>

    <p>Her smile faded. "What did you say?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"The truth. That I don't know if I'm strong enough to choose the kingdom over you."</p>

    <p>I expected anger. Disappointment.</p>

    <p>Instead, her eyes filled with tears.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"You idiot," she said, but she was smiling. "I'd choose you too. That's why we have to make sure it never comes to that."</p>

    <p>She kissed me there in the snow, and I felt complete.</p>

    <p>Glacius watched from his temple, and when we parted, he spoke one last time:</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Two powers you possess. But time grows short. Malachar's army marches. They reach the capital in two days."</p>

    <p>A vision formed in the ice, three paths:</p>

    <p><strong>The Capital</strong> - Defend now with current powers. People dying.</p>

    <p><strong>Desert of Mirrors</strong> - Seek the final Guardian, risk arriving too late.</p>

    <p><strong>Malachar's Fortress</strong> - Strike the Dark Lord while his army is away. Suicide mission.</p>

    <p>Lyra looked at me. "Your choice. Whatever you decide, I'm with you."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Partners?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Partners," she confirmed, and the word felt like a promise.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"We go for Malachar," I said. "End this at the source."</p>

    <p>Lyra's eyes widened. "That's insane."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"His army is marching on the capital. His fortress will be vulnerable."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Or heavily trapped." But she was thinking about it, I could see the tactical mind working. "If we could actually reach him..."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"We end this war before it truly begins."</p>

    <p>Glacius's crystalline form seemed to smile. "Bold. Foolish. But perhaps necessary. Very well."</p>

    <p>He raised his hand, and a portal of shimmering ice formed. "This leads to the Shadowlands' border. From there, half a day's journey to his fortress."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"It stays open until dawn. Rest tonight. You'll need your strength."</p>

    <p>One night before we faced a Dark Lord.</p>

    <p>Possibly the last night of our lives.</p>
