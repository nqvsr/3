    <h1>CHAPTER 6</h1>
    <p class="chapter-title">The Night Before Battle</p>

    <p>Glacius provided us shelter in a protected alcove of the ice temple, warmed by ancient magic. The Moonstriders stood guard as snow fell in the darkness outside.</p>

    <p>The portal would remain open until dawn.</p>

    <p>We had one night. Possibly our last.</p>

    <p>Lyra sat close to me by the magical fire, and the silence was heavy with unspoken things.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"No regrets?" she asked quietly, not looking at me.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"About the plan? Or about us?"</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Both. Either."</p>

    <p>I turned to face her fully. "I regret that we didn't have more time. That we found each other when the world is ending."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Then let's not waste what we have." She reached up, fingers tracing my jaw. "I've spent my whole life following the temple's rules. Being perfect. Never letting myself feel too much."</p>

    <p>Her violet eyes met mine, and they were blazing.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"But tomorrow we might die. And I refuse to face death without knowing what it's like to truly live. To choose what I want instead of what I'm supposed to want."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Lyra..."</p>

    <p>She kissed me, and it was different from before, hungry, desperate, full of everything we hadn't said. Everything we might never get to say.</p>

    <p>I pulled her closer, and she came willingly, her robes slipping from her shoulders.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Are you sure?" I whispered against her lips.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I've never been more sure of anything." Her hands found the clasps of my armor. "I want this. I want you. Tonight."</p>

    <div class="intimate-scene">
    <p>We made love there by the fire, under a ceiling of ancient ice and distant stars. It was passionate and tender, fierce and gentle, two people finding each other in the darkness, refusing to let fear win.</p>

    <p>Afterward, we lay tangled together beneath blankets, skin against skin, hearts beating in sync.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I love you," Lyra whispered into the quiet. "I know it's fast, I know it's probably insane, but I do. I love you."</p>

    <p>The words hit me like a physical force, beautiful, terrifying, perfect.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I love you too," I said, pulling her closer. "And we're going to survive tomorrow. We're going to win."</p>
    </div>

    <p class="dialogue">"Promise me something," she said, voice small.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Anything."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"If it comes down to a choice, me or the kingdom, choose the kingdom." She pressed a finger to my lips when I started to protest. "I mean it. I've spent my whole life wanting to matter, wanting to help. If my life can save thousands... that's a trade worth making."</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Lyra, "</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"Promise me." Her eyes were fierce. "Let me matter. Let my life mean something."</p>

    <p>I wanted to argue. To refuse. But I saw the determination in her eyes, the need to be more than what the temple had told her she was.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">"I promise," I whispered, "to make the choice that saves the most people. Even if it destroys me."</p>

    <p>She kissed me, slow and deep. "Thank you."</p>

    <p>We made love again as the night deepened, savoring every touch, every breath, every moment we had left.</p>

    <p>When we finally slept, we held each other like we could stop the dawn from coming through sheer will.</p>
