            <p>The night sky <span class="emphasis">bled</span> with falling stars.</p>
            
            <p>Kael Thornforge was just a blacksmith, until heaven itself chose him to wield a sword forged from starlight and bear the weight of humanity's final hope.</p>
            
            <p>Lyra Moonwhisper was the <span class="emphasis">Ice Queen</span> of the Moon Temple, carved into perfection by years of cruelty, taught that feeling was weakness, that love was a lie.</p>
            
            <p>Together, they must face the Dark Lord Malachar and his army of nightmares. But their greatest battle isn't with shadow beasts or ancient evil.</p>
            
            <p>It's with each other.</p>
            
            <p>And with the terrifying possibility that <span class="emphasis">loving someone might hurt more than dying for them</span>.</p>
